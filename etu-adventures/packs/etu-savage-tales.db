However, his quest for true immortality is incomplete. While Dr. Heimglimmer has returned from death with the knowledge of how to complete his transformation from hideous mummy to immortal human, the betrayal by Hector Martin and Irwin Revinowitz left him wary of trusting the eleven remaining members of his cult. Instead he bides his time watching the Black Guard from the shadows to see who remains faithful to his instructions. In fact, the surviving members of the cult are in disarray without the forceful leadership of Dr. Heimglimmer or Hector Martin keeping them in line. Of those remaining, attorney Sarah Tinsley thinks herself worthy to be the new leader of the Black Guard and aims to prove it. Having ferreted out the heroes' identities from her colleague Lisa Gray, she planned a special sacrifice that will ensure her role as Master.61</p>\n<h2>A GIFT</h2>\n<p>Shortly after Last Rites or any adventure in which they help an innocent person, the heroes are invited to the home of Sara Tinsley. Tinsley's name appeared on the list of NeoBirkhuhn found in Heimglimmer's home, but she does not know that. If they found the list, allow the students to remember that detail with a Smarts roll modified by &ndash;1 for every two semesters that have passed since finding the list. Tinsley informs them that their efforts to make Pinebox a better place have not gone unnoticed. She tells them that a local club of business leaders would like to reward them for their service and she presents them each with a check for $100 and a lapel pin. If asked, she says that the business leaders wish to remain anonymous for the time being. However, she promises that any club member who sees the lapel pin will come to their aid in times of need. The lapel pins are in fact Talismans of Servitude created by Sarah Tinsley to subjugate the heroes to her will.</p>\n<h2>TALISMAN OF SERVITUDE</h2>\n<p>Trappings: An overwhelming compulsion. Requires activation through a master token. These lapel pins focus the puppet power for six hours upon those who wear the pin at the time of activation and fail the opposed roll.</p>\n<h2>CURSE OF THE BLACK GUARD</h2>\n<p>Hours, days, or weeks later (Dean's prerogative) Tinsley activates the talismans and forces the heroes to come to her. Students who resist the compulsion remember it vividly, which may allow them to track and find their less fortunate friends. The sleuths find themselves at the ITS-ALOCK storage facility, owned by one of the Neo-Birkhuhn. This fenced and gated public storage business includes a hanger-sized building at the back with four private, locked garages for oversized vehicles such as large RVs. Heroes who fell prey to the talismans' influence are sent to one such garage, which has been converted to a ritual site. It is painted with runes, lined with candles and burning incense, and even adorned with ancient Egyptian pieces of art. Characters may make a Smarts roll to recognize certain similarities with artwork in the basement of \"Frank Manz.\" Although not talismans per se, the artwork allows ritual magic to be focused more easily (+2 Ritualism). Tinsley marches the heroes up to an altar, where she binds them and prepares them for a black magic sacrifice to enslave their souls&mdash;just as Heimglimmer had done with his victims. Tinsley is joined by three other Black Guard: Jonathan Haswell, Monique Caverly, and Samantha Delarosa. Although short on skill they are high in ambition, which is why they sided with Tinsley in her gambit for power. During the lengthy preparatory period during which Tinsley gathers her power for the ritual to come, the talismans' effect wears off. The students must find a way to escape on their own or with the help of friends who resisted the lapel pin's influence. See Ritual Magic in East Texas University for the consequence of disrupting a Black Magic ceremony during the Gathering Power phase. Because this ritual is simply a display of power to solidify her place as the NeoBirkhuhn's leader, the followers are not interested in fighting to the death. If they are Shaken, they attempt to flee. On the other hand Sarah Tinsley is committed to her goal, heart and soul, and fights until killed or disabled. &bull;<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span> Ritualist (3): Use Ritualist from East Texas University.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>Assuming the heroes survive the encounter, four Black Guard members are likely dead or gone. Those who flee the fight choose to skip the country rather than face the repercussions from the law or their fellow Neo-Birkhuhn. Recognizing that opposition has been removed, the mummy Heimglimmer summons the remaining seven loyal Neo-Birkhuhn and reveals his return. His followers begin the final preparations for the ritual that will bestow true immortality. Continue to Resurrection of the Black Guard when ready.</p>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"modules/etu-adventures/icons/logo-etu.webp","_id":"1up9GExsACYsku5P"}

However, the hideous mummy Dr. Heimglimmer was content to remain in hiding and bide his time. That time has finally come. Only recently has Heimglimmer summoned the remaining Black Guard together and revealed his resurrection. However, true immortality is not yet his. While hundreds of enslaved souls shield him from death, he is still trapped between the living and undeath as a mummy. That will change when he performs a dark ritual to regenerate his flesh and grant himself the true immortality he sought for most of his life. To achieve his aims, he instructed the remaining seven Black Guard to seek out the highly exotic components needed to perform the ritual. Yet, not all is well among the remaining Black Guard. One among them, Jenny Chapman*, was horrified at the creature Heimglimmer became and even more-so the possibility that she would meet a similar fate. She pried the gang's contact information from Lisa Gray and hopes to use the characters to stop Heimglimmer. In the first edition of Last Rites, this character was named Sylvia Valruhn. She is the \"striking brunette\" in the photos found in Dr. Heimglimmer's home. If you played the 1st edition pdf, then change her name back to Sylvia Valruhn.</p>\n<h2>THE BIG REVEAL</h2>\n<p>The gang's involvement begins with a call from a woman named Jenny Chapman, who claims that Lisa Gray recommended them for helping with her haunting. Allow a Smarts roll to recognize her name from Last Rites (if they learned it). Jenny is paranoid about Heimglimmer discovering her betrayal, so she insists on meeting somewhere private. When the sleuths meet her, they find an older, statuesque brunette who begins by confessing that she is a member of the Black Guard who wants to \"defect.\" She explains that she dated \"Frank Manz\" for a number of years, but it was only in the last few that she learned his secret. He played upon her fear of growing old and convinced her to join his Neo-Birkhuhn as a means of learning the secret to eternal youth. She explains that their encounter in Heimglimmer's house stopped Lisa Gray's haunting but created an even greater monster. Revinowitz and Martinez had turned on the Nazi, blocking his access to the spirits that kept him alive. When the cultists were defeated, Heimglimmer regained control of the souls and used them to resurrect his body as a mummy. For Jenny, the lure of eternal youth and beauty has been replaced by the reality of becoming an undying, hideous monster. The frightened cultist says that the mummy has set up court in Irwin Revinowitz's former85 home, but until Heimglimmer is denied the source of his power he is unkillable. She warns that the mummy seeks to complete his mastery over the enslaved souls, gaining true immortality. For now, each soul is bound to Heimglimmer by a personal item&mdash;a \"fetish.\" Unfortunately, after his betrayal the mummy learned his lesson and split his trove of enslaved souls into three hidden caches. To defeat the Nazi doctor, these caches must be recovered and the souls released from bondage. Jenny has only deduced the location of one of the caches, but she hopes to gather more clues from within Heimglimmer's Neo-Birkhuhn. The first cache of fetishes is located in shed 27 of the ITS-A-LOCK mini-storage facility the heroes visited in Curse of the Black Guard.</p>\n<h2>EVIL STORAGE</h2>\n<p>After the messy battle from Curse of the Black Guard, the ITS-A-LOCK owner made a token effort at appearing more secure. The characters must make a Stealth roll to evade a roaming security guard who patrols the property on a golf cart. The shed can be opened with a Lockpicking &ndash;1 roll or with the assistance of bolt cutters and a Strength roll &ndash;2. The cache of fetishes is hidden in plain sight within the Nazi's 10&times;10 storage unit. A large clear glass vase contains a collection of knickknacks, from locks of hair to spectacles. Each item, numbering in the dozens, represents a single soul enslaved by Heimglimmer. Breaking or destroying the item breaks Heimglimmer's link and frees the soul. Unfortunately, Heimglimmer panics as soon as he feels himself weaken. Since he does not know which cache was disturbed, he sends a pair of his Neo-Birkhuhn to each. If the heroes destroy the fetishes at the mini-storage, a pair of cultists arrive shortly thereafter and attack on sight. These are Heimglimmer's more fanatical Neo-Birkhuhn, who fight until dead or incapacitated. &bull; Neo-Birkhuhn (2): Use the Ritualist Extra found in East Texas University, adding the following gear: Zippo Lighter from Hell (burst talisman from East Texas University) and Colt 1911 pistol (Range 12/24/48, Damage 2d6+1, RoF 1, Shots 7, AP 1)</p>\n<h2>HE'S ONTO US</h2>\n<p>Jenny calls the gang shortly after the battle's conclusion. Heimglimmer called her, both furious and frightened. He ordered her and another Neo-Birkhuhn to retrieve a cache of his fetishes in a cemetery mausoleum, kill anyone nearby, and return immediately. The Nazi knows that he is under attack and is pushing forward the immortality ritual to today. Jenny tells the heroes that she incapacitated her cultist partner, but that it is only a matter of time before Heimglimmer deduces her betrayal. She instructs the heroes to retrieve the second set of fetishes and bring them to her house for a counter-ritual against Heimglimmer. The fetishes are where Jenny describes, although you may add a trap to the mausoleum (such as quicksand based upon the entangle power) to further challenge the heroes.</p>\n<h2>JUSTICE</h2>\n<p>When the heroes arrive at Jenny's home, they find her murdered corpse. Heroes succeeding in a Notice roll find a coil of rope and might correctly deduce that the NeoBirkhuhn she incapacitated freed himself and killed her. If the heroes search the house and make an additional Notice roll, they note a trail of soil leading from the garage to the kitchen. Stretched out upon the kitchen table is a crude sculpture of a man made from a mixture of clay and dark, rich graveyard soil. Its forehead is marked by a series of Hebrew letters. Those with Knowledge (Hebrew) or a successful Investigation roll decipher the word \"Justice.\" A Knowledge (Occult) roll allows the heroes to identify this figure as a golem. This particular specimen has a cavity in its chest where its heart would be. With a Knowledge (Occult) &ndash;1 roll or a Smarts &ndash;2 roll to recollect Jenny's last phone call, the heroes deduce that they should take the fetishes she asked them to save and place them within the cavity. Doing so and covering the cavity with more dirt completes the ritual, allowing the golem to animate. The golem arises from the kitchen table and silently plods out of the house. It pays no attention to the heroes, but only follows its own internal instinct to take the closest path to its goal. Should the heroes not find the golem or choose to destroy the fetishes instead, the mummy is still weakened but does not have the distraction of the golem's attack.</p>\n<h2>SHOWDOWN</h2>\n<p>Since Jenny told them that the mummy was at Revinowitz's house, the heroes should have little question as to their next destination. If in doubt they can follow the golem's trail. Heimglimmer and his four remaining NeoBirkhuhn have begun gathering power for the immortality ritual in the pool house at the rear of the property. Central to the ritual is the small pile of soul fetishes (the final third). If the heroes successfully animated the golem, it disrupts the process upon its arrival (see \"Casting\" in the The Dean's List chapter of East Texas University). If the golem was not animated then the heroes must distract the ritualists and obtain the fetishes. The final encounter is a straight up fight. Unfortunately, as long as even some of his fetishes remain, Heimglimmer regenerates at an alarming rate. Only once the fetishes are destroyed can the mummy be killed once and for all.</p>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"modules/etu-adventures/icons/logo-etu.webp","_id":"QmFpKujWqZVw7zm3"}
