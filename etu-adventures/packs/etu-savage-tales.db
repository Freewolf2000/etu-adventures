However, the hideous mummy @Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Dr Franz Heimglimmer]{Dr. Heimglimmer} was content to remain in hiding and bide his time. That time has finally come. Only recently has @Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Dr Franz Heimglimmer]{Dr. Heimglimmer} summoned the remaining Black Guard together and revealed his resurrection.</p>\n<p>However, true immortality is not yet his. While hundreds of enslaved souls shield him from death, he is still trapped between the living and undeath as a mummy. That will change when he performs a dark ritual to regenerate his flesh and grant himself the true immortality he sought for most of his life. To achieve his aims, he instructed the remaining seven Black Guard to seek out the highly exotic components needed to perform the ritual.</p>\n<p>Yet, not all is well among the remaining Black Guard. One among them, Jenny Chapman*, was horrified at the creature @Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Dr Franz Heimglimmer]{Dr. Heimglimmer} became and even more-so the possibility that she would meet a similar fate. She pried the gang's contact information from Lisa Gray and hopes to use the characters to stop Heimglimmer.</p>\n<p><em>In the first edition of Last Rites, this character was named Sylvia Valruhn. She is the \"striking brunette\" in the photos found in @Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Dr Franz Heimglimmer]{Dr. Heimglimmer}'s home. If you played the 1st edition pdf, then change her name back to Sylvia Valruhn.</em></p>\n<h2>THE BIG REVEAL</h2>\n<p>The gang's involvement begins with a call from a woman named Jenny Chapman, who claims that Lisa Gray recommended them for helping with her haunting. Allow a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Traits]{Smarts} roll to recognize her name from Last Rites (if they learned it). Jenny is paranoid about @Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Dr Franz Heimglimmer]{Dr. Heimglimmer} discovering her betrayal, so she insists on meeting somewhere private.</p>\n<p>When the sleuths meet her, they find an older, statuesque brunette who begins by confessing that she is a member of the Black Guard who wants to \"defect.\" She explains that she dated \"Frank Manz\" for a number of years, but it was only in the last few that she learned his secret. He played upon her fear of growing old and convinced her to join his Neo-Birkhuhn as a means of learning the secret to eternal youth.</p>\n<p>She explains that their encounter in @Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Dr Franz Heimglimmer]{Dr. Heimglimmer}'s house stopped Lisa Gray's haunting but created an even greater monster. Revinowitz and Martinez had turned on the Nazi, blocking his access to the spirits that kept him alive. When the cultists were defeated, @Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Dr Franz Heimglimmer]{Dr. Heimglimmer} regained control of the souls and used them to resurrect his body as a mummy. For Jenny, the lure of eternal youth and beauty has been replaced by the reality of becoming an undying, hideous monster.</p>\n<p>The frightened cultist says that the mummy has set up court in Irwin Revinowitz's former85 home, but until @Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Dr Franz Heimglimmer]{Dr. Heimglimmer} is denied the source of his power he is unkillable. She warns that the mummy seeks to complete his mastery over the enslaved souls, gaining true immortality. For now, each soul is bound to @Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Dr Franz Heimglimmer]{Dr. Heimglimmer} by a personal item&mdash;a \"fetish.\" Unfortunately, after his betrayal the mummy learned his lesson and split his trove of enslaved souls into three hidden caches. To defeat the Nazi doctor, these caches must be recovered and the souls released from bondage.</p>\n<p>Jenny has only deduced the location of one of the caches, but she hopes to gather more clues from within @Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Dr Franz Heimglimmer]{Dr. Heimglimmer}'s Neo-Birkhuhn. The first cache of fetishes is located in shed 27 of the @Compendium[etu-rules.etu-setting-rules.ITS-A-LOCK]{ITS-A-LOCK} mini-storage facility the heroes visited in @Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-savage-tales.Curse of the Black Guard]{Curse of the Black Guard}.</p>\n<h2>EVIL STORAGE</h2>\n<p>After the messy battle from @Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-savage-tales.Curse of the Black Guard]{Curse of the Black Guard}, the @Compendium[etu-rules.etu-setting-rules.ITS-A-LOCK]{ITS-A-LOCK} owner made a token effort at appearing more secure. The characters must make a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.★ Stealth]{Stealth} roll to evade a roaming security guard who patrols the property on a golf cart. The shed can be opened with a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Thievery]{Thievery} &ndash;1 roll or with the assistance of bolt cutters and a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Traits]{Strength} roll &ndash;2.</p>\n<p>The cache of fetishes is hidden in plain sight within the Nazi's 10&times;10 storage unit. A large clear glass vase contains a collection of knickknacks, from locks of hair to spectacles. Each item, numbering in the dozens, represents a single soul enslaved by @Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Dr Franz Heimglimmer]{Dr. Heimglimmer}. Breaking or destroying the item breaks @Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Dr Franz Heimglimmer]{Dr. Heimglimmer}'s link and frees the soul.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, @Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Dr Franz Heimglimmer]{Dr. Heimglimmer} panics as soon as he feels himself weaken. Since he does not know which cache was disturbed, he sends a pair of his Neo-Birkhuhn to each. If the heroes destroy the fetishes at the mini-storage, a pair of cultists arrive shortly thereafter and attack on sight. These are @Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Dr Franz Heimglimmer]{Dr. Heimglimmer}'s more fanatical Neo-Birkhuhn, who fight until dead or incapacitated.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>@Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Neo-Birkhuhn]{Neo-Birkhuhn} (2): Use the Ritualist Extra found in East Texas University, adding the following gear: Zippo Lighter from Hell (burst talisman from East Texas University) and Colt 1911 pistol (Range 12/24/48, Damage 2d6+1, RoF 1, Shots 7, AP 1)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>HE'S ONTO US</h2>\n<p>Jenny calls the gang shortly after the battle's conclusion. @Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Dr Franz Heimglimmer]{Dr. Heimglimmer} called her, both furious and frightened. He ordered her and another Neo-Birkhuhn to retrieve a cache of his fetishes in a cemetery mausoleum, kill anyone nearby, and return immediately. The Nazi knows that he is under attack and is pushing forward the immortality ritual to today.</p>\n<p>Jenny tells the heroes that she incapacitated her cultist partner, but that it is only a matter of time before @Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Dr Franz Heimglimmer]{Dr. Heimglimmer} deduces her betrayal. She instructs the heroes to retrieve the second set of fetishes and bring them to her house for a counter-ritual against @Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Dr Franz Heimglimmer]{Dr. Heimglimmer}.</p>\n<p>The fetishes are where Jenny describes, although you may add a trap to the mausoleum (such as quicksand based upon the <em>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-powers.Entangle]{entangle}</em> power) to further challenge the heroes.</p>\n<h2>JUSTICE</h2>\n<p>When the heroes arrive at Jenny's home, they find her murdered corpse. Heroes succeeding in a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.★ Notice]{Notice} roll find a coil of rope and might correctly deduce that the NeoBirkhuhn she incapacitated freed himself and killed her.</p>\n<p>If the heroes search the house and make an additional @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.★ Notice]{Notice} roll, they note a trail of soil leading from the garage to the kitchen. Stretched out upon the kitchen table is a crude sculpture of a man made from a mixture of clay and dark, rich graveyard soil. Its forehead is marked by a series of Hebrew letters. Those with Language (Hebrew) or a successful @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Research]{Research} roll decipher the word \"Justice.\"</p>\n<p>A @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Occult]{Occult} roll allows the heroes to identify this figure as a @Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Golem]{golem}. This particular specimen has a cavity in its chest where its heart would be. With a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Occult]{Occult} &ndash;1 roll or a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Traits]{Smarts} &ndash;2 roll to recollect Jenny's last phone call, the heroes deduce that they should take the fetishes she asked them to save and place them within the cavity. Doing so and covering the cavity with more dirt completes the ritual, allowing the @Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Golem]{golem} to animate. The @Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Golem]{golem} arises from the kitchen table and silently plods out of the house. It pays no attention to the heroes, but only follows its own internal instinct to take the closest path to its goal.</p>\n<p>Should the heroes not find the @Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Golem]{golem} or choose to destroy the fetishes instead, the mummy is still weakened but does not have the distraction of the golem's attack.</p>\n<h2>SHOWDOWN</h2>\n<p>Since Jenny told them that the mummy was at Revinowitz's house, the heroes should have little question as to their next destination. If in doubt they can follow the golem's trail.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Dr Franz Heimglimmer]{Dr. Heimglimmer} and his four remaining NeoBirkhuhn have begun gathering power for the immortality ritual in the pool house at the rear of the property. Central to the ritual is the small pile of soul fetishes (the final third). If the heroes successfully animated the @Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Golem]{golem}, it disrupts the process upon its arrival (see \"@Compendium[etu-rules.etu-setting-rules.Casting Ritual Magic]{Casting Ritual Magic}\" in the The Dean's List chapter of East Texas University). If the @Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Golem]{golem} was not animated then the heroes must distract the ritualists and obtain the fetishes.</p>\n<p>The final encounter is a straight up fight. Unfortunately, as long as even some of his fetishes remain, @Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Dr Franz Heimglimmer]{Dr. Heimglimmer} regenerates at an alarming rate. Only once the fetishes are destroyed can the mummy be killed once and for all.</p>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"modules/etu-adventures/icons/logo-etu.webp","_id":"4V0sIQ3F8AquhK1w"}

This is the night when evil is purportedly at its most powerful. This year the addition of a full moon and the Convergence (if you're playing the Plot Point Campaign) magnifies the havoc in Pinebox like never before. Tonight, the heroes are drawn into a shared nightmare.</p>\n<h2>NIGHTMARE SCAPE</h2>\n<p>Each student awakens at dawn to the continuous wail of sirens. Doors to neighboring dorm rooms or apartments are left open and in complete disarray. The power is out city-wide and the local radio station is off the air. Although cell phones work, no one other than other heroes answer. A @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.★ Notice]{Notice} roll reveals that cells phones and other battery-operated devices show the date as the day after Graduation. They have missed the Convergence.</p>\n<p>Even if the characters suspect that it is all a nightmare, they cannot awaken until the end of the adventure. This should feel like Hell on Earth, with everyone they've come to know having suffered horrific consequences. Outside, the streets are littered with the dead, undead, and the wholly unnatural. The only other human visible far down the street is mobbed and killed by a pack of gremlins right before a hero's eyes.</p>\n<p>Should the characters contact one another and plan a meeting, every moment spent outdoors increases their chances of being discovered and overrun. Treat their travel through the town as a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Dramatic Tasks]{Dramatic Task}. Those who fail are cornered and torn apart by demons.</p>\n<h2>SURVIVOR</h2>\n<p>If the heroes manage to gather, they encounter another survivor (ideally a well-known NPC) who was witness to the devastation. He describes a cloud of death rolling over campus, followed by a horde of demons and undead ravaging those who survived the initial onslaught.</p>\n<h2>END RUN</h2>\n<p>Demons continue to prowl the area in which the students assemble. Even the sanctuary (see Sanctuary on page 23) is not completely secure from such overwhelming supernatural activity. Demons make @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.★ Notice]{Notice} rolls until the heroes are discovered. The creature makes a warbling shriek and is soon joined by others of its kind. Throw wave after wave of demons and zombies until they are clearly trapped and fighting a losing battle. Finally, an &uuml;berdemon stomps up to the fringe of battle, lets out a roar and prepares to charge.</p>\n<p>&hellip;and the heroes awaken from their shared nightmare with a certainty that they've just glimpsed the future.

Later, he realized the journal contained Chafe's chemical formula for bestowing mental control over insects. Thinking to capitalize on the discovery, Ruiz perfected the drug by separating specific insect DNA and recombining it with Chafe's feeding compound. Unlike the original formula, Eddie's version is administered directly to the bloodstream.</p>\n<p>Eddie has taken the serum for more than two weeks and begun suffering from paranoia over his secret being stolen. He thinks his formula will win him accolades from the scientific community, and by \"scientific community\" he means the attractive Dr. Sheila West. Naturally, he was crushed to learn that Dr. West had begun dating her colleague Dr. Lyle Canton. Worse, he realized that the new formula was changing him into a bizarre, insect-humanoid. With his sanity slipping and his powers over other insects blossoming, the graduate student took matters into his own hands to make Dr. West his \"queen.\"</p>\n<h2>THE STING</h2>\n<p>The adventure begins as one or more of the sleuths make their way to class in the Life Sciences building on a Monday morning. A shriek rings out from down the hall and gawkers quickly form near a professor's office doorway. Inside lies the gruesome body of Entomology professor Dr. Lyle Canton, covered in hundreds of insect bites and stings. A search of the office fails to reveal more than a few harmless insects still secure in their terrariums. A relevant Knowledge roll such as @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Healing]{Healing} or a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Traits]{Smarts} &ndash;2 roll reveals that the poor professor appeared to have died early in the weekend.</p>\n<h2>AN OLD FRIEND</h2>\n<p>If the characters played Bugs, this should be enough to alert the students that either Johnny Chafe has returned or someone else has continued his experiments. If Chafe is still alive and at ETU, he answers their questions upon a successful @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.★ Persuasion]{Persuasion} roll. His disposition toward the characters greatly depends upon how they resolved Bugs, so adjust the difficulty accordingly. With a raise, Johnny also discloses the missing notebook and a suspicion that it was stolen.</p>\n<h2>INVESTIGATION</h2>\n<p>A visit to the ETU Insectary and a successful @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Networking]{Networking} roll reveals that Dr. Sheila West and her graduate student, Eddie Ruiz, failed to appear to give a lecture. With a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Trait Rolls]{raise}, they also learn that Ruiz had a crush on his professor.</p>\n<p>The addresses of both can be found with a little time on the Internet and a successful @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Research]{Research} roll. Ruiz lives in a one bedroom, second floor apartment. Breaking in requires a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Thievery]{Thievery} roll, or the door has a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Characters]{Toughness} of 8 if they want to @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Breaking Things]{kick it in}. The apartment is unoccupied other than countless insects which scurry across the floors, walls, and ceiling. If the students enter, they should make a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Fear]{Fear} roll from all the scuttling insects. The apartment offers no clue as to Ruiz's current whereabouts, but a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.★ Notice]{Notice} &ndash;2 roll reveals strange shapes reminiscent of armor plating discarded on the floor. A @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Science]{Science} roll -2 allows the student to identify these as abnormally large molted exoskeleton.</p>\n<h2>THE QUEEN</h2>\n<p>Dr. West lives in a brick home in upscale @Compendium[etu-rules.etu-setting-rules.Timberland Village]{Timberland Village}, a gated community off @Compendium[etu-rules.etu-setting-rules.Lake Greystone]{Lake Greystone} favored by better-paid ETU professors and administrators. An older, compact economy car is parked in the driveway but no one answers the front door. A @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.★ Notice]{Notice}&nbsp; &ndash;1 roll reveals a spare key hidden above the door frame. Alternately, the front door can be opened with a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Thievery]{Thievery} &ndash;1 roll. The backyard patio door can be opened with a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Thievery]{Thievery} roll, or the glass broken with any successful attack (Parry 2). Students forcing their way in should make a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.★ Stealth]{Stealth} roll to avoid a call to the police from observant neighbors.</p>\n<p>As at Eddie's apartment, Dr. West's house is infested with all manner of crawling and flying insects. The creature that had once been Eddie Ruiz is biding his time inside, watching the cocoon that holds the unlucky Dr. West. Eddie attacks as soon as he notices the heroes. He has grown an exoskeleton, large eyes, and two sucker-like fangs. He can also control up to 2 swarms.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-bestiary.Swarm]{Swarm} (2): As in the Savage Worlds rulebook.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>Attempts to publicize Eddie's transformation are dismissed as another lame college hoax.</p>\n<p>If the heroes rescue Dr. West, the cocoon breaks easily and she awakens in two days.

The child's mother couldn't deal with the loss and committed suicide, while her father turned to alcohol, eventually losing his job and being evicted.</p>\n<p>Now @Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Niles Henry]{Niles Henry} has struck again, taking a ten year old named Dawn Ramirez from the elementary school playground. Police issued an Amber Alert, but after two days still have no leads. @Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Niles Henry]{Niles} hasn't killed Dawn yet, but he will do so in two more days.

If appropriate to your campaign, Christa reaches out again once Niles chooses a third victim.</p>\n<p>If the sleuths stop, they find no sign of the girl. However, they do find tattered yellow crime scene tape wrapped around some trees and decayed remains of a small funeral wreath (left by Christa's mother).

Later, he realized the journal contained Chafe's chemical formula for bestowing mental control over insects. Thinking to capitalize on the discovery, Ruiz perfected the drug by separating specific insect DNA and recombining it with Chafe's feeding compound. Unlike the original formula, Eddie's version is administered directly to the bloodstream.</p>\n<p>Eddie has taken the serum for more than two weeks and begun suffering from paranoia over his secret being stolen. He thinks his formula will win him accolades from the scientific community, and by \"scientific community\" he means the attractive Dr. Sheila West. Naturally, he was crushed to learn that Dr. West had begun dating her colleague Dr. Lyle Canton. Worse, he realized that the new formula was changing him into a bizarre, insect-humanoid. With his sanity slipping and his powers over other insects blossoming, the graduate student took matters into his own hands to make Dr. West his \"queen.\"</p>\n<h2>THE STING</h2>\n<p>The adventure begins as one or more of the sleuths make their way to class in the Life Sciences building on a Monday morning. A shriek rings out from down the hall and gawkers quickly form near a professor's office doorway. Inside lies the gruesome body of Entomology professor Dr. Lyle Canton, covered in hundreds of insect bites and stings. A search of the office fails to reveal more than a few harmless insects still secure in their terrariums. A relevant Knowledge roll such as @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Healing]{Healing} or a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Traits]{Smarts} &ndash;2 roll reveals that the poor professor appeared to have died early in the weekend.</p>\n<h2>AN OLD FRIEND</h2>\n<p>If the characters played Bugs, this should be enough to alert the students that either Johnny Chafe has returned or someone else has continued his experiments. If Chafe is still alive and at ETU, he answers their questions upon a successful @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.★ Persuasion]{Persuasion} roll. His disposition toward the characters greatly depends upon how they resolved Bugs, so adjust the difficulty accordingly. With a raise, Johnny also discloses the missing notebook and a suspicion that it was stolen.</p>\n<h2>INVESTIGATION</h2>\n<p>A visit to the ETU Insectary and a successful @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Networking]{Networking} roll reveals that Dr. Sheila West and her graduate student, Eddie Ruiz, failed to appear to give a lecture. With a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Trait Rolls]{raise}, they also learn that Ruiz had a crush on his professor.</p>\n<p>The addresses of both can be found with a little time on the Internet and a successful @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Research]{Research} roll. Ruiz lives in a one bedroom, second floor apartment. Breaking in requires a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Thievery]{Thievery} roll, or the door has a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Characters]{Toughness} of 8 if they want to @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Breaking Things]{kick it in}. The apartment is unoccupied other than countless insects which scurry across the floors, walls, and ceiling. If the students enter, they should make a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Fear]{Fear} roll from all the scuttling insects. The apartment offers no clue as to Ruiz's current whereabouts, but a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.★ Notice]{Notice} &ndash;2 roll reveals strange shapes reminiscent of armor plating discarded on the floor. A @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Science]{Science} roll -2 allows the student to identify these as abnormally large molted exoskeleton.</p>\n<h2>THE QUEEN</h2>\n<p>Dr. West lives in a brick home in upscale @Compendium[etu-rules.etu-setting-rules.Timberland Village]{Timberland Village}, a gated community off @Compendium[etu-rules.etu-setting-rules.Lake Greystone]{Lake Greystone} favored by better-paid ETU professors and administrators. An older, compact economy car is parked in the driveway but no one answers the front door. A @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.★ Notice]{Notice}&nbsp; &ndash;1 roll reveals a spare key hidden above the door frame. Alternately, the front door can be opened with a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Thievery]{Thievery} &ndash;1 roll. The backyard patio door can be opened with a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Thievery]{Thievery} roll, or the glass broken with any successful attack (Parry 2). Students forcing their way in should make a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.★ Stealth]{Stealth} roll to avoid a call to the police from observant neighbors.</p>\n<p>As at Eddie's apartment, Dr. West's house is infested with all manner of crawling and flying insects. The creature that had once been Eddie Ruiz is biding his time inside, watching the cocoon that holds the unlucky Dr. West. Eddie attacks as soon as he notices the heroes. He has grown an exoskeleton, large eyes, and two sucker-like fangs. He can also control up to 2 swarms.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-bestiary.Swarm]{Swarm} (2): As in the Savage Worlds rulebook.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>Attempts to publicize Eddie's transformation are dismissed as another lame college hoax.</p>\n<p>If the heroes rescue Dr. West, the cocoon breaks easily and she awakens in two days. (Use Professor from East Texas University if necessary.) She checks out okay, but secretly has not survived unchanged. Dr. West can now control insects as well, though she suffers none of Eddie's mental problems and means no one harm.</p>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"modules/etu-adventures/icons/logo-etu.webp","_id":"QzHarwRT6nIlA4YS"}

However, the hideous mummy @Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Dr Franz Heimglimmer]{Dr. Heimglimmer} was content to remain in hiding and bide his time. That time has finally come. Only recently has @Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Dr Franz Heimglimmer]{Dr. Heimglimmer} summoned the remaining Black Guard together and revealed his resurrection.</p>\n<p>However, true immortality is not yet his. While hundreds of enslaved souls shield him from death, he is still trapped between the living and undeath as a mummy. That will change when he performs a dark ritual to regenerate his flesh and grant himself the true immortality he sought for most of his life. To achieve his aims, he instructed the remaining seven Black Guard to seek out the highly exotic components needed to perform the ritual.</p>\n<p>Yet, not all is well among the remaining Black Guard. One among them, Jenny Chapman*, was horrified at the creature @Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Dr Franz Heimglimmer]{Dr. Heimglimmer} became and even more-so the possibility that she would meet a similar fate. She pried the gang's contact information from Lisa Gray and hopes to use the characters to stop Heimglimmer.</p>\n<p><em>In the first edition of Last Rites, this character was named Sylvia Valruhn. She is the \"striking brunette\" in the photos found in @Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Dr Franz Heimglimmer]{Dr. Heimglimmer}'s home. If you played the 1st edition pdf, then change her name back to Sylvia Valruhn.</em></p>\n<h2>THE BIG REVEAL</h2>\n<p>The gang's involvement begins with a call from a woman named Jenny Chapman, who claims that Lisa Gray recommended them for helping with her haunting. Allow a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Traits]{Smarts} roll to recognize her name from Last Rites (if they learned it). Jenny is paranoid about @Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Dr Franz Heimglimmer]{Dr. Heimglimmer} discovering her betrayal, so she insists on meeting somewhere private.</p>\n<p>When the sleuths meet her, they find an older, statuesque brunette who begins by confessing that she is a member of the Black Guard who wants to \"defect.\" She explains that she dated \"Frank Manz\" for a number of years, but it was only in the last few that she learned his secret. He played upon her fear of growing old and convinced her to join his Neo-Birkhuhn as a means of learning the secret to eternal youth.</p>\n<p>She explains that their encounter in @Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Dr Franz Heimglimmer]{Dr. Heimglimmer}'s house stopped Lisa Gray's haunting but created an even greater monster. Revinowitz and Martinez had turned on the Nazi, blocking his access to the spirits that kept him alive. When the cultists were defeated, @Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Dr Franz Heimglimmer]{Dr. Heimglimmer} regained control of the souls and used them to resurrect his body as a mummy. For Jenny, the lure of eternal youth and beauty has been replaced by the reality of becoming an undying, hideous monster.</p>\n<p>The frightened cultist says that the mummy has set up court in Irwin Revinowitz's former85 home, but until @Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Dr Franz Heimglimmer]{Dr. Heimglimmer} is denied the source of his power he is unkillable. She warns that the mummy seeks to complete his mastery over the enslaved souls, gaining true immortality. For now, each soul is bound to @Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Dr Franz Heimglimmer]{Dr. Heimglimmer} by a personal item&mdash;a \"fetish.\" Unfortunately, after his betrayal the mummy learned his lesson and split his trove of enslaved souls into three hidden caches. To defeat the Nazi doctor, these caches must be recovered and the souls released from bondage.</p>\n<p>Jenny has only deduced the location of one of the caches, but she hopes to gather more clues from within @Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Dr Franz Heimglimmer]{Dr. Heimglimmer}'s Neo-Birkhuhn. The first cache of fetishes is located in shed 27 of the @Compendium[etu-rules.etu-setting-rules.ITS-A-LOCK]{ITS-A-LOCK} mini-storage facility the heroes visited in @Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-savage-tales.Curse of the Black Guard]{Curse of the Black Guard}.</p>\n<h2>EVIL STORAGE</h2>\n<p>After the messy battle from @Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-savage-tales.Curse of the Black Guard]{Curse of the Black Guard}, the @Compendium[etu-rules.etu-setting-rules.ITS-A-LOCK]{ITS-A-LOCK} owner made a token effort at appearing more secure. The characters must make a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.★ Stealth]{Stealth} roll to evade a roaming security guard who patrols the property on a golf cart. The shed can be opened with a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Thievery]{Thievery} &ndash;1 roll or with the assistance of bolt cutters and a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Traits]{Strength} roll &ndash;2.</p>\n<p>The cache of fetishes is hidden in plain sight within the Nazi's 10&times;10 storage unit. A large clear glass vase contains a collection of knickknacks, from locks of hair to spectacles. Each item, numbering in the dozens, represents a single soul enslaved by @Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Dr Franz Heimglimmer]{Dr. Heimglimmer}. Breaking or destroying the item breaks @Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Dr Franz Heimglimmer]{Dr. Heimglimmer}'s link and frees the soul.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, @Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Dr Franz Heimglimmer]{Dr. Heimglimmer} panics as soon as he feels himself weaken. Since he does not know which cache was disturbed, he sends a pair of his Neo-Birkhuhn to each. If the heroes destroy the fetishes at the mini-storage, a pair of cultists arrive shortly thereafter and attack on sight. These are @Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Dr Franz Heimglimmer]{Dr. Heimglimmer}'s more fanatical Neo-Birkhuhn, who fight until dead or incapacitated.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>@Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Neo-Birkhuhn]{Neo-Birkhuhn} (2): Use the Ritualist Extra found in East Texas University, adding the following gear: Zippo Lighter from Hell (burst talisman from East Texas University) and Colt 1911 pistol (Range 12/24/48, Damage 2d6+1, RoF 1, Shots 7, AP 1)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>HE'S ONTO US</h2>\n<p>Jenny calls the gang shortly after the battle's conclusion. @Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Dr Franz Heimglimmer]{Dr. Heimglimmer} called her, both furious and frightened. He ordered her and another Neo-Birkhuhn to retrieve a cache of his fetishes in a cemetery mausoleum, kill anyone nearby, and return immediately. The Nazi knows that he is under attack and is pushing forward the immortality ritual to today.</p>\n<p>Jenny tells the heroes that she incapacitated her cultist partner, but that it is only a matter of time before @Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Dr Franz Heimglimmer]{Dr. Heimglimmer} deduces her betrayal. She instructs the heroes to retrieve the second set of fetishes and bring them to her house for a counter-ritual against @Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Dr Franz Heimglimmer]{Dr. Heimglimmer}.</p>\n<p>The fetishes are where Jenny describes, although you may add a trap to the mausoleum (such as quicksand based upon the <em>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-powers.Entangle]{entangle}</em> power) to further challenge the heroes.</p>\n<h2>JUSTICE</h2>\n<p>When the heroes arrive at Jenny's home, they find her murdered corpse. Heroes succeeding in a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.★ Notice]{Notice} roll find a coil of rope and might correctly deduce that the NeoBirkhuhn she incapacitated freed himself and killed her.</p>\n<p>If the heroes search the house and make an additional @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.★ Notice]{Notice} roll, they note a trail of soil leading from the garage to the kitchen. Stretched out upon the kitchen table is a crude sculpture of a man made from a mixture of clay and dark, rich graveyard soil. Its forehead is marked by a series of Hebrew letters. Those with Language (Hebrew) or a successful @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Research]{Research} roll decipher the word \"Justice.\"</p>\n<p>A @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Occult]{Occult} roll allows the heroes to identify this figure as a @Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Golem]{golem}.

With a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Occult]{Occult} &ndash;1 roll or a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Traits]{Smarts} &ndash;2 roll to recollect Jenny's last phone call, the heroes deduce that they should take the fetishes she asked them to save and place them within the cavity. Doing so and covering the cavity with more dirt completes the ritual, allowing the @Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Golem]{golem} to animate. The @Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Golem]{golem} arises from the kitchen table and silently plods out of the house. It pays no attention to the heroes, but only follows its own internal instinct to take the closest path to its goal.</p>\n<p>Should the heroes not find the @Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Golem]{golem} or choose to destroy the fetishes instead, the mummy is still weakened but does not have the distraction of the golem's attack.</p>\n<h2>SHOWDOWN</h2>\n<p>Since Jenny told them that the mummy was at Revinowitz's house, the heroes should have little question as to their next destination. If in doubt they can follow the golem's trail.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Dr Franz Heimglimmer]{Dr. Heimglimmer} and his four remaining NeoBirkhuhn have begun gathering power for the immortality ritual in the pool house at the rear of the property. Central to the ritual is the small pile of soul fetishes (the final third). If the heroes successfully animated the @Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Golem]{golem}, it disrupts the process upon its arrival (see \"@Compendium[etu-rules.etu-setting-rules.Casting Ritual Magic]{Casting Ritual Magic}\" in the The Dean's List chapter of East Texas University). If the @Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Golem]{golem} was not animated then the heroes must distract the ritualists and obtain the fetishes.</p>\n<p>The final encounter is a straight up fight.

This is the night when evil is purportedly at its most powerful. This year the addition of a full moon and the Convergence (if you're playing the Plot Point Campaign) magnifies the havoc in Pinebox like never before. Tonight, the heroes are drawn into a shared nightmare.</p>\n<h2>NIGHTMARE SCAPE</h2>\n<p>Each student awakens at dawn to the continuous wail of sirens. Doors to neighboring dorm rooms or apartments are left open and in complete disarray. The power is out city-wide and the local radio station is off the air. Although cell phones work, no one other than other heroes answer. A @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.★ Notice]{Notice} roll reveals that cells phones and other battery-operated devices show the date as the day after Graduation. They have missed the Convergence.</p>\n<p>Even if the characters suspect that it is all a nightmare, they cannot awaken until the end of the adventure. This should feel like Hell on Earth, with everyone they've come to know having suffered horrific consequences. Outside, the streets are littered with the dead, undead, and the wholly unnatural. The only other human visible far down the street is mobbed and killed by a pack of gremlins right before a hero's eyes.</p>\n<p>Should the characters contact one another and plan a meeting, every moment spent outdoors increases their chances of being discovered and overrun. Treat their travel through the town as a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Dramatic Tasks]{Dramatic Task}. Those who fail are cornered and torn apart by demons.</p>\n<h2>SURVIVOR</h2>\n<p>If the heroes manage to gather, they encounter another survivor (ideally a well-known NPC) who was witness to the devastation. He describes a cloud of death rolling over campus, followed by a horde of demons and undead ravaging those who survived the initial onslaught.</p>\n<h2>END RUN</h2>\n<p>Demons continue to prowl the area in which the students assemble. Even the sanctuary (see Sanctuary on page 23) is not completely secure from such overwhelming supernatural activity. Demons make @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.★ Notice]{Notice} rolls until the heroes are discovered. The creature makes a warbling shriek and is soon joined by others of its kind. Throw wave after wave of demons and zombies until they are clearly trapped and fighting a losing battle. Finally, an &uuml;berdemon stomps up to the fringe of battle, lets out a roar and prepares to charge.</p>\n<p>&hellip;and the heroes awaken from their shared nightmare with a certainty that they've just glimpsed the future. It is the morning of Graduation Day and the world is still safe&mdash; for the time being. Characters keep experience earned but erase @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Damage Effects]{Wounds}, @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Fatigue]{Fatigue}, or @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Fear]{Fear} effects.
