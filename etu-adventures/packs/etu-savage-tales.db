During a late-night class project in the Big Thicket, students meet a 10-year-old girl named Violet Evans. She's a ghost, and she died on her birthday. The investigation of her 50-year-old murder reveals an ancient cycle of supernatural evil, with a trail of unlikely victims in its wake.</p>\n<p>Due to disturbing themes, this mystery is best suited for mature and adult players. It can be integrated into an existing Degrees of Horror campaign (with the years in which events happen altered as needed), or you can run it as a one-shot with the pre-generated characters provided at the end of the adventure.</p>\n<section class=\"ridged-block-float\">\n<h3>THE FIRST SACRIFICE</h3>\n<p>On March 20, 1968, Violet Evans turned 10. She lived on a ranch with her family just outside Pinebox. Her gentle and caring brother, Gilbert Evans, who was 20 years old at the time, was put in charge of her while their parents were away in Houston. Unfortunately, while exploring a long-hidden cave he discovered nearby, he found a strange pendant which seemed to call to him, and upon picking it up he was immediately possessed by an evil demon spirit named Kromax.</p>\n<p>Gilbert returned home, cut a wire out of the family piano, went into the living room where his sister played with a doll&mdash;and strangled her to death. He discarded the wire in the cold fireplace, and performed a blood-draining ritual on Violet's body in the basement, guided by the ravenous demon-spirit within him. When his parents, Richard and Lucy, came home the next morning (March 21), he locked them in the basement with his dead sister and set the house on fire.</p>\n<p>Gilbert was subsequently accused of arson and murder, but with no proof the jury was forced to acquit. A few years passed, and the pendant Gilbert wore changed him mentally and physically. He became more muscular, his face developed mild deformities, and his voice became slurred and mush-mouthed. After several years' absence, he changed his name to Tom Gil and moved back to a large plot of undeveloped land only eight miles from the old Evans ranch. Kromax began to thirst once more.</p>\n</section>\n<h3>AN ELUSIVE PATTERN</h3>\n<p>Kromax is ancient. He first appeared at the dawn of man, and has killed hundreds of people over thousands of years following a simple but elusive pattern. The demon spirit thirsts for blood at an exact interval equal to the age of his current host's first victim when he or she died. Subsequent victims must have been born on the day when his first victim was killed (<strong>The First Sacrifice</strong>). This makes each subsequent victim progressively older by the interval amount. When potential victims have all died off, Kromax simply seeks a new host and the cycle begins again.</p>\n<p>In the past, this pattern has gone unnoticed by would-be investigators because it is almost undetectable in its infrequency and variability (for example, one cycle might have had an interval of 23 years, five months and three days). In Tom Gil's case, however, the timing of his sister's murder offers the heroes a unique opportunity. Violet was killed on the exact day of her tenth birthday (March 20, 1968). Because the date she was killed (March 20) is also the birthdate and death-date of all future victims, it is much easier to spot what is happening than at any other time in Kromax's history.</p>\n<p>Thanks to Kromax, Tom Gil is instinctually drawn to the victims he needs. Now 70 years old, he has been expertly following this supernatural schedule for 50 years.</p>\n<p><strong>VIOLET EVANS:</strong> <em>Killed&mdash;March 20, 1968. </em>Violet was Gilbert's sister and the \"First Sacrifice.\" Kromax murdered her on her tenth birthday. He covered up his crime by setting fire to his house with his parents and Violet's body in the basement. The charred remains of her and her parents are buried at @Compendium[etu-rules.etu-setting-rules.Pinebox City Cemetery]{Pinebox City Cemetery}. Gilbert subsequently changed his name to Tom Gil.</p>\n<p><strong>TOBY WILLIAMS: </strong><em>Body Found&mdash;March 22, 1978.</em> A local boy in the Morganville area, Toby Williams was about to turn 10 when Tom Gil kidnapped him on March 18, 1978. His body was found a few days later, drifting down the Trail Blaze Stream outside @Compendium[etu-rules.etu-setting-rules.Pinebox]{Pinebox}. Toby is also buried at @Compendium[etu-rules.etu-setting-rules.Pinebox City Cemetery]{Pinebox City Cemetery}.</p>\n<p><strong>DIANA WHITESIDE: </strong><em>Reported Missing&mdash;March 17, 1988. </em>Diana Whiteside lived in @Compendium[etu-rules.etu-setting-rules.Pinebox]{Pinebox}. She went missing 30 years ago, three days before her twentieth birthday. Her body was never found, and she was later presumed dead.</p>\n<p><strong>KEVIN RAY: </strong><em>Reported Missing&mdash;March 18, 1998. </em>Kevin Ray lived in @Compendium[etu-rules.etu-setting-rules.Shinbone Springs]{Shinbone Springs}. He went missing two days before his thirtieth birthday, 20 years ago, and was later presumed dead. His body was never found.</p>\n<p><strong>DARLA SWEET: </strong><em>Reported Missing&mdash;March 16, 2008. </em>Forty-year-old Darla Sweet was kidnapped from her hometown of @Compendium[etu-rules.etu-setting-rules.Blackburn]{Blackburn}. She is still officially listed as missing.</p>\n<h3>50 YEARS LATER</h3>\n<p>On the morning of March 18, 2018&mdash;the day the adventure starts&mdash;Tom Gil kidnaps @Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Zak Riley]{Zak Riley}, a 50-year-old pediatrician, born to a native tribe in Alaska, but living in nearby @Compendium[etu-rules.etu-setting-rules.Timberland Village]{Timberland Village}. Zak is a gentle-spirited and well-respected doctor, beloved by his young patients and their parents. He also lives alone, having lost his wife to cancer several years ago. There is no evidence Zak was kidnapped except that he is missing. As the scenario begins, he is locked inside a cage in Tom Gil's basement and still alive&mdash;but not for long.</p>\n<h3>A GHOST AMONG THE NIGHT BLOOMS</h3>\n<p>On March 18, 2018, it is spring break at @Compendium[etu-rules.etu-setting-rules.East Texas University]{East Texas University}. One or more members of the study group use the break as an opportunity to complete a homework assignment for their biology class: studying certain varieties of night-blooming flowers in the Big Thicket just outside @Compendium[etu-rules.etu-setting-rules.Pinebox]{Pinebox}.</p>\n<p>They may be camping, or just out for the evening, and others not in their class might have come along for the fun of it, for romantic reasons, or simply because they have a vehicle that can accommodate everyone. In any case, the students should all have a reason to be there. Read the following:</p>\n<section class=\"simple-block\">\n<p>It is unseasonably cold, and the moon shines bright as you study and catalog various flowers. Suddenly, the ghostly form of a little girl appears in front of you. She clutches an old-style doll in her arms and wears a new-looking but dated sundress. She whimpers in a distant voice, \"Help me!\" and beckons for you to follow her. She recedes down an old, overgrown driveway that otherwise would have been almost impossible to spot.</p>\n</section>\n<br />\n<section class=\"secret\">\n<p><strong>Knowledge Check: </strong>It's easy to see the style of the girl's dress isn't modern, but a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Academics]{Academics} or @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.★ Common Knowledge]{Common Knowledge} (&minus;2) roll nails down the period as the late Sixties.</p>\n</section>\n<br />\n<h3>THE EVANS RANCH</h3>\n<p>As the little girl leads the students a short distance to the Evans ranch, she talks to them, but it takes effort. She says her name is Violet Evans and offers other telling phrases like,</p>\n<section class=\"simple-block\">\n<p>\"It's almost my birthday,\" and \"That's when my brother killed me.\"</p>\n</section>\n<p>The overgrown driveway gives way to a clearing where the outline of what used to be a ranch house remains. It is cluttered with old debris, and plants have taken back the land. The only standing structure is a crumbling fireplace. Violet leads the study group to the house and slowly points at the fireplace, repeating,</p>\n<section class=\"simple-block\">\n<p>\"My brother killed me. Please help.\"</p>\n</section>\n<p>Under some rubble in the fireplace students find the coiled-up piano wire Tom used to kill Violet (see <strong>Forensic Clue 1</strong>). Because of its location, it did not burn in the house fire and still has old, black bloodstains on it&mdash;one on the center of the wire (Violet's) and two more on either edge of it (Tom's). Only DNA testing can determine this definitively, however. The piano wire is a critical clue, and does not require a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.★ Notice]{Notice} roll to find.</p>\n<p>Students who explore further find the remains of a root cellar under some rubble. Violet points to the cellar and says,</p>\n<section class=\"simple-block\">\n<p>\"Mommy and daddy. He killed them too.\"</p>\n</section>\n<p>Gaining access to the cellar requires a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.★ Athletics]{Athletics} roll to deal with the rubble. Failure still gains them access but causes each digger a level of @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Fatigue]{Fatigue} (from Bumps and Bruises) that lasts for 24 hours.</p>\n<h3>THE VISION</h3>\n<p>Once in the basement, students have a vision of Gilbert, Violet, and what happened to their parents just before they died. Alternatively, heroes may instead see the vision in the form of a dream later that night.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>@Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-savage-tales.CDoVE: Basement Vision]{Basement Vision}.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While experiencing the vision, a student who succeeds on a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Science]{Science} roll (-1) or @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Healing]{Healing} roll (+2) can tell Violet's body has been emptied of blood. The vision or dream itself is @Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-savage-tales.CDoVE: Basement Vision]{Supernatural Clue 1}. On a successful @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.★ Notice]{Notice} roll (&minus;2), students see a clear image of the pendant Gilbert wears around his neck.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>@Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-savage-tales.CDoVE: Pendant Symbol]{Pendant Symbol}.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Students visiting the basement after seeing the vision or dream and succeeding on another @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.★ Notice]{Notice} roll find an old, ceramic wall hanging collecting dust among the rubble. It has \"The Evans Family\" written on top, \"Richard\" and \"Lucy\" in the middle, and \"Gilbert\" and \"Violet\" at the bottom. There is no internet or cellphone signal at the Evans ranch, so further investigation must wait until students return to campus.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>@Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Violet Evans]{Violet Evans}: </strong>Use the Ghost profile in East Texas University with the abilities <em>illusion</em>, <em>haunting grounds</em> (the Evans ranch, and her grave), <em>resolution</em>, and <em>weak</em>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>RESEARCH CLUES</h3>\n<p>The most straightforward way to find out more about Violet and her family is with an internet search, or at the local library or newspaper archive. Two newspaper articles are easy to find with a simple @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Research]{Research} roll. On a failure the heroes still find them, but it takes more time or creates some other complication.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>@Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-savage-tales.CDoVE: Evans Ranch Burns]{Evans Ranch Burns}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-savage-tales.CDoVE: Gilbert Evans Aquitted]{Gilbert Evans Aquitted}</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Students who dive into occult research based on their experience in the basement easily find information on blood-draining demon spirits (@Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-savage-tales.CDoVE: Blood Draining]{Reseach Clue 4}), but may not specifically identify Kromax (@Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-savage-tales.CDoVE: Elusive Demon Spirits]{Research Clue 5}) unless they either see his symbol in the vision, start to discern the pattern of the murders, or conduct further research on rare, blood-draining rituals based on components they might have seen in the vision.</p>\n<p>Identifying Kromax is a critical clue, so even if researchers don't find it right away, they find it eventually&mdash;preferably at the most dramatic time.</p>\n<p>The crew only finds the newspaper article on Toby Williams (@Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-savage-tales.CDoVE:&nbsp;Body of Toby Williams Found]{Research Clue 3}) or information on Tom Gil's other victims (see <strong>An Elusive Pattern</strong>) if they know what to search for. They may find it when investigating similar crimes in 10-year increments if they obtain information on Kromax, or if they are lured to Toby's grave at the cemetery (see Supernatural Clues, below) and decide to research his name. This may lead dogged students to the ritual, expuls&eacute; Kromaxia (see page 9).</p>\n<h3>SUPERNATURAL CLUES</h3>\n<p>The Evans family is buried in @Compendium[etu-rules.etu-setting-rules.Pinebox City Cemetery]{Pinebox City Cemetery}. The students can visit them readily during normal business hours, or they can break in at night and use @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.★ Stealth]{Stealth} or distractions to avoid the security guard. The cemetery supervisor is Karla Von&mdash;she is sweet and a bit creepy, interested in the supernatural but only as a hobby. She doesn't really believe in it. She happily helps the students find the Evans' graves, although she knows little about the family. Three simple gravestones stand side by side, one for each family member. They have not been visited recently except by cemetery maintenance.</p>\n<p>The body of Toby Williams, the second victim, is buried here too. Toby reaches out to anyone with the @Compendium[etu-rules.etu-edges.Psychically Sensitive]{Psychically Sensitive} Edge (absent the Edge, the student with the highest @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Traits]{Spirit}) and tries to draw them to his grave. His tombstone reads, <em>\"Toby Williams. Born March 20, 1968. Died March 20, 1978.\"</em></p>\n<p>Everyone feels Toby's presence at the gravesite. If they attempt a <em>@Compendium[etu-rules.etu-powers.Grave Speak]{grave speak}</em> ritual (see page 9 for details), Toby's ghost tells the group,</p>\n<section class=\"simple-block\">\n<p>\"He said his name was Tom Gil. He promised me ice cream for my birthday. He hurt me and I couldn't even hear my own screams!\"</p>\n</section>\n<p>Toby can describe Tom's basement, but not where Tom is located. If the students do not perform a ritual Toby still appears, but only very briefly in an unstable way.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Karla Von:</strong> Use the @Compendium[etu-rules.etu-bestiary.Campus Security Officer]{Campus Security Officer} profile in East Texas University.</li>\n<li><strong>Toby Williams:</strong> Use the @Compendium[etu-rules.etu-bestiary.Ghost]{Ghost} profile in East Texas University with the abilities <em>@Compendium[etu-rules.etu-bestiary-abilities.Imprint]{Imprint}</em> and <em>@Compendium[etu-rules.etu-bestiary-abilities.Resolution]{Resolution}</em>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>FORENSIC CLUES</h3>\n<p>The students already have the piano wire (Forensic Clue 1, below), and there are ways they can follow up on it forensically. However, DNA collection and testing takes more time than new victim Zak Riley has, and Violet seeks resolution, not legal proof.</p>\n<p>Insistent students can get the wire DNA-tested, which reveals two different blood samples. A DNA sample from Violet's remains, and one from Tom Gil (if they can get one) confirms Violet's blood is on the center of the wire, and Tom's is on the edges. Scars on Tom Gil's fingers and signs of strangulation on what remains of Violet's neck further corroborate this narrative.</p>\n<p>This can get a bit gruesome, but if investigators manage to gather all this evidence, they can legally prove Tom Gil killed Violet. It may not matter, however, since by the time all this is done, Zak's fate has already been decided one way or the other.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Forensic Clue 1:</strong> Piano Wire. \"A length of piano wire with old blood stains on it. There is blood on the center of the wire, and more blood on each end of the wire.\"</li>\n</ul>\n</div>","img":"modules/etu-adventures/icons/logo-etu.webp","_id":"2uxHQP7kQnbdPuwh"}
{"name":"Curious Death of Violet Evans: Saving Zak","permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_nx6ogwo213","path":"Savage Tales#/CF_SEP/Savage Tales","color":"#000000"}},"content":"<div class=\"swade-core\">\n<div class=\"section-header\">\n<h1>Curious Death of Violet Evans</h1>\n</div>\n<div>\n<h3>CONFRONTING TOM GIL</h3>\n<p>@Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Tom Gil]{Tom Gil} lives in a simple ranch house on a large piece of property in the Big Thicket, just eight miles from the old Evans ranch. Tom is supernaturally strong and subsists on a garden, hunting, and trading. He lives \"off the grid,\" and his house has no electricity or basic utilities. Tom's house has a front door, back door, and a locked storm door leading directly into the basement (a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Thievery]{Thievery} or @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Breaking Things]{break down the door}).</p>\n<p>Gil's neighbors are almost as private as he is. They describe him as a solitary type and rarely seen.</p>\n<h3>TOM'S HOUSE</h3>\n<p>The students must find Tom's house before midnight on March 20. If they don't, Tom performs the ritual and kills Zak Riley. Any time before that, whenever students arrive, Gil is in the basement making final preparations for the ritual. He is unconcerned with anything outside, so a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.★ Stealth]{Stealth} roll is not required to sneak up to the house (although you may call for one for dramatic purposes).</p>\n<p>If the students knock on an outside door, there is no answer. There are sealed, clouded basement windows next to the storm door, which reveal flickering candlelight and Tom's hulking shape moving around, placing candles around a pentagram.</p>\n<p>Zak Riley is on his knees, locked in a small metal cage built into one of the basement walls. His head is badly injured from Tom's bat, and he is clearly terrified. He looks like he is pleading with Tom, yet the students hear no sound coming from the basement.</p>\n<p>Entering the house from another direction reveals the creepy interior, with plain wooden furniture and only the bare necessities for life. Trespassers who make successful @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.★ Notice]{Notice} rolls discover several tomes of black magic containing rituals like zombie, invisibility, and a unique ward of silence (see below). The door to the basement is in the kitchen, where knives, frying pans, and other improvised weapons are found.</p>\n<h3>WARD OF SILENCE</h3>\n<p>Tom has a special ward on his body that nullifies all sound within the basement area except his own voice and movements. The ward is so powerful that if Tom Gil makes no noise, no sound at all can exist in a radius of 12\" (24 yards) around him. This is very disorienting, and inflicts a &minus;1 penalty to Trait rolls by anyone except Tom Gil and his zombies.</p>\n<p>Success on a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Occult]{Occult} roll (&ndash;2) determines a patch on Tom's back is the focus of the silence ward. It can be broken with a successful @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Called Shots]{Called Shot} (&ndash;2) on the patch. Once sound rushes back in, @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Traits]{Spirit} rolls are required for everyone in the basement&mdash;except Gil and his zombies&mdash;to avoid being @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Damage Effects]{Shaken}.</p>\n<h3>RESCUING ZAK RILEY</h3>\n<p>If the students delay or call the sheriff to deal with the problem, Tom begins his ritual. His slurred voice can be heard speaking an unknown language anywhere in the house, and outside the storm door to the basement. When he becomes aware of the students, Tom Gil calls his zombies&mdash;formerly Diana Whiteside, Kevin Ray, and Darla Sweet&mdash;from a room adjoining the basement to aid him. They are rotting, bony creatures now, but still dressed in the tatters of their old clothes. They brandish claws and their eyes are dark and lifeless.</p>\n<p>Seeing Tom up close requires a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Fear]{Fear} roll (&minus;2). If players think to ask, heroes see the scars on Tom's fingers consistent with cutting them on the piano wire 50 years prior. Tom attacks anyone who enters the basement or tries to free Zak from his cage (@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Thievery]{Thievery} &ndash;4,&nbsp; or @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Breaking Things]{Heavy Door}). If the students attempt to remove the pendant from Tom, they can make a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Fighting]{Fighting} roll at &ndash;4 for the @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Called Shots]{Called Shot} to grab it, then an @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Trait Rolls]{opposed} @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.★ Athletics]{Athletics} roll to wrest it from Tom.</p>\n<p>If the pendant is removed, Tom Gil regresses to his old 70-year-old self&mdash;thin, emaciated, confused, and on the verge of death from his ordeal. When Tom collapses so do the zombies. However, the person who removed the pendant must make an opposed @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Traits]{Spirit} roll to avoid being possessed by Kromax (Spirit d8, @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Wild Cards and Extras]{Wild Card}). Kromax uses a possessed student to fight their friends.</p>\n<p>If the attempt fails, Kromax tries each round to possess anyone touching the pendant. If it's dropped, Kromax still resides inside it until expuls&eacute; Kromaxia is cast successfully to banish him.</p>\n<p>Regardless of how Tom Gil is defeated, he expresses inconsolable grief for the murders he has committed, especially his beloved sister. Shortly afterward, he dies.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>@Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Tom Gil]{Tom Gil}</strong></li>\n<li><strong>@Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Zak Riley]{Zak Riley}</strong></li>\n<li><strong>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-bestiary.Zombie]{Zombies} (3): </strong>These are the zombie remains of Diana Whiteside, Kevin Ray, and Darla Sweet&mdash;Tom Gil&rsquo;s third, fourth, and fifth victims. They are dressed in the tatters of their former clothes and have dark, black eyes. They become @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Damage Effects]{incapacitated} automatically if the pendant is removed from Tom Gil, or if Kromax is banished.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>AFTERMATH</h3>\n<p>If students wait for the authorities to arrive before confronting Tom Gil, or if Tom defeats them, Zak dies. If they rely on the sheriff&rsquo;s department to handle the problem entirely, Kromax kills Zak and also possesses one of the officers&mdash;and disappears.</p>\n<p>If the heroes defeat Tom, Zak has a bad concussion and has lost his voice from screaming into the silence. He recovers with medical attention. Zak is an exceptional doctor, and his gratitude makes him a potentially valuable connection for the group in future adventures.</p>\n<p>The bodies of Tom&rsquo;s previous victims and Zak&rsquo;s presence are proof enough to close the case on Tom legally. If the study group also turns the piano wire over to the authorities, they perform all the DNA testing required to also prove Tom&rsquo;s identity and his responsibility for the murder of Violet Evans.</p>\n<p>Regardless of the state of legal proof, in a quiet moment after it is all over, Violet visits the students one last time with tears in her eyes and relief in her face. She shimmers and fades just as the outline of a larger ghost, her brother, appears beside her. She looks up and smiles, whispers an earnest &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; to the heroes, and then takes Gilbert&rsquo;s hand as they both fade away forever.</p>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"modules/etu-adventures/icons/logo-etu.webp","_id":"4xqAhiLfUkIC01eI"}

However, his quest for true immortality is incomplete. While @Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Dr Franz Heimglimmer]{Dr. Heimglimmer} has returned from death with the knowledge of how to complete his transformation from hideous mummy to immortal human, the betrayal by Hector Martin and Irwin Revinowitz left him wary of trusting the eleven remaining members of his cult. Instead he bides his time watching the Black Guard from the shadows to see who remains faithful to his instructions.</p>\n<p>In fact, the surviving members of the cult are in disarray without the forceful leadership of @Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Dr Franz Heimglimmer]{Dr. Heimglimmer} or Hector Martin keeping them in line. Of those remaining, attorney @Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Sarah Tinsley]{Sarah Tinsley} thinks herself worthy to be the new leader of the Black Guard and aims to prove it. Having ferreted out the heroes' identities from her colleague Lisa Gray, she planned a special sacrifice that will ensure her role as Master.</p>\n</section>\n<h3>A GIFT</h3>\n<p>Shortly after Last Rites or any adventure in which they help an innocent person, the heroes are invited to the home of @Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Sarah Tinsley]{Sarah Tinsley}. Tinsley's name appeared on the list of NeoBirkhuhn found in Heimglimmer's home, but she does not know that. If they found the list, allow the students to remember that detail with a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Traits]{Smarts} roll modified by &ndash;1 for every two semesters that have passed since finding the list.</p>\n<p>Tinsley informs them that their efforts to make @Compendium[etu-rules.etu-setting-rules.Pinebox]{Pinebox} a better place have not gone unnoticed. She tells them that a local club of business leaders would like to reward them for their service and she presents them each with a check for $100 and a lapel pin. If asked, she says that the business leaders wish to remain anonymous for the time being. However, she promises that any club member who sees the lapel pin will come to their aid in times of need.</p>\n<p>The lapel pins are in fact Talismans of Servitude created by @Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Sarah Tinsley]{Sarah Tinsley} to subjugate the heroes to her will.</p>\n<h3>TALISMAN OF SERVITUDE</h3>\n<p>Trappings: An overwhelming compulsion.</p>\n<p>Requires activation through a master token. These lapel pins focus the <em>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-powers.Puppet]{puppet}</em> power for six hours upon those who wear the pin at the time of activation and fail the @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Trait Rolls]{opposed roll}.</p>\n<h3>CURSE OF THE BLACK GUARD</h3>\n<p>Hours, days, or weeks later (Dean's prerogative) Tinsley activates the talismans and forces the heroes to come to her. Students who resist the compulsion remember it vividly, which may allow them to track and find their less fortunate friends.</p>\n<p>The sleuths find themselves at the @Compendium[etu-rules.etu-setting-rules.ITS-A-LOCK]{ITS-A-LOCK} storage facility, owned by one of the Neo-Birkhuhn. This fenced and gated public storage business includes a hanger-sized building at the back with four private, locked garages for oversized vehicles such as large RVs. Heroes who fell prey to the talismans' influence are sent to one such garage, which has been converted to a ritual site. It is painted with runes, lined with candles and burning incense, and even adorned with ancient Egyptian pieces of art. Characters may make a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Traits]{Smarts} roll to recognize certain similarities with artwork in the basement of \"Frank Manz.\" Although not talismans per se, the artwork allows @Compendium[etu-rules.etu-setting-rules.Casting Ritual Magic]{Ritual Magic} to be focused more easily (+2 @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Occult]{Occult}).</p>\n<p>Tinsley marches the heroes up to an altar, where she binds them and prepares them for a black magic sacrifice to enslave their souls&mdash;just as @Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Dr Franz Heimglimmer]{Heimglimmer} had done with his victims. Tinsley is joined by three other Black Guard: Jonathan Haswell, Monique Caverly, and Samantha Delarosa. Although short on skill they are high in ambition, which is why they sided with @Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Sarah Tinsley]{Sarah Tinsley} in her gambit for power.</p>\n<p>During the lengthy preparatory period during which Tinsley gathers her power for the ritual to come, the talismans' effect wears off. The students must find a way to escape on their own or with the help of friends who resisted the lapel pin's influence. See @Compendium[etu-rules.etu-setting-rules.Casting Ritual Magic]{Ritual Magic} for the consequence of disrupting a @Compendium[etu-rules.etu-setting-rules.Black Magic]{Black Magic} ceremony during the @Compendium[etu-rules.etu-setting-rules.Casting Ritual Magic]{Gathering Power}&nbsp;phase.</p>\n<p>Because this ritual is simply a display of power to solidify her place as the NeoBirkhuhn's leader, the followers are not interested in fighting to the death. If they are @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Damage Effects]{Shaken}, they attempt to flee. On the other hand @Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Sarah Tinsley]{Sarah Tinsley} is committed to her goal, heart and soul, and fights until killed or disabled.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Ritualist (3): </strong>Use Ritualist from East Texas University.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>CONCLUSION</h3>\n<p>Assuming the heroes survive the encounter, four Black Guard members are likely dead or gone. Those who flee the fight choose to skip the country rather than face the repercussions from the law or their fellow Neo-Birkhuhn. Recognizing that opposition has been removed, the mummy @Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Dr Franz Heimglimmer]{Dr. Heimglimmer}&nbsp; summons the remaining seven loyal Neo-Birkhuhn and reveals his return. His followers begin the final preparations for the ritual that will bestow true immortality.

This is the night when evil is purportedly at its most powerful. This year the addition of a full moon and the Convergence (if you're playing the Plot Point Campaign) magnifies the havoc in Pinebox like never before. Tonight, the heroes are drawn into a shared nightmare.</p>\n</section>\n<h3>NIGHTMARE SCAPE</h3>\n<p>Each student awakens at dawn to the continuous wail of sirens. Doors to neighboring dorm rooms or apartments are left open and in complete disarray. The power is out city-wide and the local radio station is off the air. Although cell phones work, no one other than other heroes answer. A @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.★ Notice]{Notice} roll reveals that cells phones and other battery-operated devices show the date as the day after Graduation. They have missed the Convergence.</p>\n<p>Even if the characters suspect that it is all a nightmare, they cannot awaken until the end of the adventure. This should feel like Hell on Earth, with everyone they've come to know having suffered horrific consequences. Outside, the streets are littered with the dead, undead, and the wholly unnatural. The only other human visible far down the street is mobbed and killed by a pack of gremlins right before a hero's eyes.</p>\n<p>Should the characters contact one another and plan a meeting, every moment spent outdoors increases their chances of being discovered and overrun. Treat their travel through the town as a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Dramatic Tasks]{Dramatic Task}.

He describes a cloud of death rolling over campus, followed by a horde of demons and undead ravaging those who survived the initial onslaught.</p>\n<h3>END RUN</h3>\n<p>Demons continue to prowl the area in which the students assemble. Even the sanctuary (see Sanctuary on page 23) is not completely secure from such overwhelming supernatural activity. Demons make @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.★ Notice]{Notice} rolls until the heroes are discovered. The creature makes a warbling shriek and is soon joined by others of its kind. Throw wave after wave of demons and zombies until they are clearly trapped and fighting a losing battle. Finally, an &uuml;berdemon stomps up to the fringe of battle, lets out a roar and prepares to charge.</p>\n<p>&hellip;and the heroes awaken from their shared nightmare with a certainty that they've just glimpsed the future.

The study group is done with winter final exams, so it's time to PARTAY! A friend of the students invites them out to her weekend hunting cabin deep in the Big Thicket. It's far from fancy, but it has plumbing, electricity, and a cheery stone fireplace to keep the recent cold snap at bay. It'll be a great place for nature hikes, playing board games, quiet research among a stack of books, or challenges to sobriety.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the study group isn't the only ones in the forest this winter. Not only have a troop of skunk apes settled down for the winter, but a trio of twitchy criminals have hidden a meth lab in a campsite they thought was far from prying eyes. One of these drug dealers shot at a shadow in the woods and injured a skunk ape. Although normally timid around humans, the remaining creatures are enraged and ready to strike out at any humans who cross their paths.</p>\n</section>\n<h3>A CABIN IN THE WOODS</h3>\n<p>Although the hunting cabin isn't far from ETU as the crow flies, the roads go from pavement to gravel to dirt to overgrown logging trail. Eventually, the heroes arrive at a small cabin. A small diesel generator provides electricity when needed, such as for the water well or appliances. There is not enough diesel to run the generator continuously for the duration of their stay, so the students must learn to use it sparingly. Although simple, the cabin is comfortable and a blaze in the fireplace makes it downright cheery. Allow the study group and their host to settle into their new quarters and explore the area if they wish. If the group is spending Friday and Saturday night, the Dean may wish to let the first night pass uneventfully or use the ETU Adventure Generator for an unrelated event. At the very least it's likely time for some High Strangeness.</p>\n<h3>FIRST ENCOUNTER</h3>\n<p>The @Compendium[etu-rules.etu-bestiary.Skunk Ape]{skunk apes} don't approach the cabin until nightfall. If any students venture outdoors more than a few hours after sunset, they can clearly make out hooting calls and answers coming from multiple directions as the angry creatures scout the area. The sounds become louder as the @Compendium[etu-rules.etu-bestiary.Skunk Ape]{skunk apes} approach, until even those inside the cabin hear them.</p>\n<p>If the students make loud noises, shine a powerful flashlight into the woods, or act as though they are about to venture out, the noises end abruptly. Otherwise the sounds continue for ten minutes before tapering off. The skunk apes are not yet close enough to the cabin for the study group to detect their odor.</p>\n<h3>SECOND ENCOUNTER</h3>\n<p>After the students have time to settle down from the first encounter, the @Compendium[etu-rules.etu-bestiary.Skunk Ape]{skunk apes} approach closer to the cabin and pelt it with small items such as twigs and tiny rocks. They start slowly, at first making only a few attacks that sound like rain or falling nuts or branches from the trees above. Once the students take note of the noise, allow a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.★ Notice]{Notice} roll for them to see some of these missiles hit a cabin window.</p>\n<p>The missiles themselves are too small to cause harm and aren't necessarily aimed at individuals, just the general area. The creatures lob the projectiles at a high arc from the darkness, making it nearly impossible to determine the direction of the attack. Over time, the frequency increases until the cabin and any vehicles parked nearby are being pelted with small items every few seconds.</p>\n<p>Unlike before, the pelting continues even if the students make a loud noise or move to investigate. In fact, the missiles converge on the general area of the person who took action. This continues for another thirty seconds before tapering off. See Into the Woods below if the heroes brave the woods to search for clues after the attack.</p>\n<h3>THE VISITOR</h3>\n<p>Only a few minutes after the second encounter, a man in his early twenties stumbles up to the cabin. He introduces himself as Charlie and tells the students he was lost in the dark until he saw the light from their cabin.</p>\n<p>Charlie was one of three men at the meth lab campsite. Although he doesn't mention the meth, he tells the students about an attack on his campsite that sparked a fire (true, but due to the volatile chemicals, not the attack itself). All three people fled the camp into the forest and almost immediately became separated and lost. With no flashlight, Charlie has been stumbling around in near freezing temperatures since shortly after dark. Charlie is tired, scared, and on edge. Although he is appreciative of a chance to warm himself by the fire, he desperately wants to get back to civilization. If he can't get someone to take him back to @Compendium[etu-rules.etu-setting-rules.Pinebox]{Pinebox} that night, his paranoia begins to take over.</p>\n<p>He looks for an opportunity to steal car keys and find the vehicle they go with. If that doesn't work he tries to get one or two students alone and begs. If that doesn't get him out of the woods he pulls his revolver and demands the keys.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Charlie:</strong> Use the stats for @Compendium[world.etu-bestiary.Thug]{Thug} found in East Texas University.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>THIRD ENCOUNTER</h3>\n<p>After the camp calms down again (or if Charlie tries leaving in a stolen vehicle), the @Compendium[etu-rules.etu-bestiary.Skunk Ape]{skunk apes} work up their rage to make a true attack&mdash;they have no idea the students aren't part of the criminals who injured them. The wild noises return, as do the missiles. This time however, the creatures throw much larger objects such as broken tree branches and large rocks.</p>\n<p>Being struck by these items cause Str+d4 damage. The cabin windows shatter under the attack and it sound as if the dinner-plate sized rocks will pound a hold through the roof. This barrage on the camp continues for half an hour before tapering off and calls for a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Fear]{Fear} roll at &ndash;2.</p>\n<h3>INTO THE WOODS</h3>\n<p>Students who have the @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Survival]{Survival} skill can make a roll at &ndash;2 to search for the tracks of their attackers. They can search after any of the encounters above, but there are no tracks to find until after the second encounter. If the students wait until the next morning to investigate, the roll is only at &ndash;1. A Success allows them to find a large primate footprint in the soft forest soil. A @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Trait Rolls]{raise} on the roll allows them to find a good set leading away from the cabin deeper into the dark woods. Alternately, the heroes can make a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.★ Notice]{Notice} roll to follow their noses and the sound of a wounded animal coming from the forest beyond their cabin.</p>\n<p>As they venture deeper into the woods, the stench grows stronger. Eventually they reach a forest hollow where a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.★ Notice]{Notice} roll reveals a dark form lying partially concealed under a bed of dry pine needles. This is the adult @Compendium[etu-rules.etu-bestiary.Skunk Ape]{skunk ape}&nbsp;wounded by the meth dealer's wild gunshot. It is in terrible pain and drifting in and out of consciousness.</p>\n<p>The students may attempt to clean and dress the creatures' wound using a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Healing]{Healing} roll, but they must make @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Traits]{Vigor} checks as usual due to the skunk ape Stench special ability. The skunk ape struggles weakly if the heroes attempt to move it back to their campsite, but the greatest danger comes from its remaining family who shadow the humans just beyond the edge of their lights. Any threatening action invokes an immediate, violent response. If the students successfully heal the cryptid, over the next hour they witness its amazing healing properties take hold and it rapidly improves. It stares at the students with wariness for a long while, then stands to its feet and silently lopes off into the forest where it is greeted with far more hoots and cries than the heroes realized were present.</p>\n<p>The students may take as many pictures as they wish, including selfies with the semiconscious creature. Later, all photos are ridiculed as poor fakes.</p>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"modules/etu-adventures/icons/logo-etu.webp","_id":"F2uGTP1pWAU3ZHn3"}

Veronica quickly covered up the incident, fearing a failing lab grade for a safety violation. While cleaning up, some of the dark liquid absorbed through her skin.</p>\n</section>\n<h3>SOMETHING IS WRONG WITH ME</h3>\n<p>Either due to their friendship or reputation for helping people with strange problems, several days after the accident Veronica seeks help from the heroes.

She is also well on her way to completely losing her mind.

With enough digging and a successful @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Research]{Research} &ndash;2 roll, the sleuths learn that the professor studies and catalogs substances provided by the United States Homeland Security department. The exact source and nature of the materials is classified.</p>\n<p>To stop the effects, the students must steal a sample of the same black, oily research waste from the lab and perform their own analysis or find a sympathetic accomplice. Although the substance itself defies classification and appears highly toxic, with a successful roll in @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Science]{Science} or similar, they realize that the substance breaks down under @Compendium[etu-rules.etu-setting-rules.Ultraviolet Light]{UV} light. Fortunately for Veronica, the mystery substance literally only goes skin deep, permeating no further than the dermis layer. If the characters can lure her into a lab @Compendium[etu-rules.etu-setting-rules.Ultraviolet Light]{UV} sterilization chamber or even a tanning booth (sunlight is insufficient), the substance can be rendered inert. Destroying the malady requires at least 15 minutes of high @Compendium[etu-rules.etu-setting-rules.Ultraviolet Light]{UV}&nbsp;exposure for each day since the original accident. This process may be done in short duration \"treatments\" to prevent skin burns.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>@Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Living Shadow]{Living Shadow}</strong></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"modules/etu-adventures/icons/logo-etu.webp","_id":"KKLHMWwR1odpi2gf"}

He is also smart enough to piece together three separate historical accounts to guess the general location of a cache of Confederate silver ingots stolen during the Civil War.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, that still leaves a wide area to search. Primed with the motive and the means, Montague hiked into the Big Thicket and found the old ruins of the hideout where the gang of turncoats had been caught, gunned down, and buried. There, he attempted a s&eacute;ance from a ritual he found on the Internet. It wasn't until the ritual was complete that he realized it was mislabeled. Instead of merely speaking with the turncoat's spirit, Montague raised a zombie.</p>\n<p>Although terrified at first, Montague realized he could use the zombie to lead him to the hidden treasure. The student left the thing in place and returned home to collect his notes and a shovel for the treasure hunt to come, but ended up falling into an exhausted sleep.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, miles away a troop of skunk apes stirred&hellip;</p>\n</section>\n<h3>CAUGHT ON CAMERA!</h3>\n<p>The adventure begins for the study group with a call from GlenMac (see East Texas University). A colleague in the Wildlife Management program contacted him about a photo from a motion-activated trail camera showing something outlandish. The photo appears to be of a dead man walking down the trail away from the camera. Only scraps of clothes still cling to its body, which is little more than skin-wrapped bone. The professor is certain one of his students is pranking him, but GlenMac is far less sure. He asks the study group to visit the trail, but avoid the trail camera if possible.</p>\n<h3>ON THE TRAIL</h3>\n<p>Following GlenMac's directions and a US Forest Service map, the heroes can drive up an old logging road to the trail. There, they find a beat up, late-model pickup truck parked nearby. The truck is locked, but if anyone thinks to check they find the hood still warm to the touch. This truck belongs to Montague, who has returned to the forest to complete his treasure hunt. Cell phone service is weak to nonexistent here and on the trail.</p>\n<p>The game trail is relatively easy to find, given that Montague, the Wildlife professor, and various wild animals have all used it recently. The group can follow the trail using @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Survival]{Survival} at +1, or @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Traits]{Smarts} at &ndash;1 with a US Forest Service map. With a raise on either, the student makes out an occasional, faint shoeprint in the soil (modern&mdash;it's Montague's).</p>\n<p>In addition to the rolls and encounters which follow, the hike to the trail camera area makes a good time for additional encounters using the ETU Adventure Generator or the Dean's own devising. Some High Strangeness goes well here as well.</p>\n<p>While hiking the first section of trail, the heroes make a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.★ Notice]{Notice} roll for every 15 minutes of travel for a total of three rolls.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>First roll:</strong> A Success means the student realizes the forest has become unnaturally quiet. The only animal sound comes from crows squawking far in the distance. With a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Trait Rolls]{raise}, she hears a leaves being disturbed somewhere in the distance.</li>\n<li><strong>Second roll: </strong>Success hears a soft hoot from one side of the trail which is repeated after a few moments from the other side. With a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Trait Rolls]{raise}, the student knows the noise came from something other than an owl. Give a +1 to this roll to students who have heard a skunk ape on a previous adventure.</li>\n<li><strong>Third roll: </strong>Success means the character catches a whiff of something like a cross between skunk and a rotting carcass. The smell is so revolting it's difficult to tell its source, but fortunately it is too fleeting to require a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Traits]{Vigor} roll. The student with the highest Success also catches a quick glimpse of a dark figure watching from behind a large tree just at the edge of their vision. Of course if they approach the spot they find no one and no clear tracks, though there are signs someone or something was here.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>After 45 minutes of hiking, the students reach a branch in the trail. The big red X on GlenMac's map signifies the trail camera is still some distance ahead. A @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Survival]{Survival} roll reveals shoe prints following the branch to the right. If the group investigates the branch, proceed to Summons below. If they keep to the path leading to the trail camera, skip to <em><strong>Trail Encounter</strong></em>.</p>\n<h3>SUMMONS</h3>\n<p>Have the hikers make a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.★ Notice]{Notice} roll after about fifteen minutes along the trail. Those who make it get the distinct, uncomfortable feeling of being watched. The trail leads up a hilltop to a clearing, both of which are charged with occult energy. As the students climb the last dozen feet to the hilltop, hit them with some High Strangeness.</p>\n<p>In the small clearing at the crest, Montague has just concluded his black magic ritual of necromancy. A zombie at his feet begins to rise, but even more (at least four per student) are in the process of clawing out of their longforgotten graves! This calls for a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Fear]{Fear} roll, then proceed to <em><strong>Nobody Will Ever Believe This</strong></em>, below.</p>\n<h3>TRAIL ENCOUNTER</h3>\n<p>As the students proceed further down the trail, those who pass a Notice roll get the uncomfortable feeling of being watched.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the study group must make another @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Survival]{Survival} roll to pinpoint their location on the map and estimate their distance to the trail camera. Failure means they walk right past the camera and travel another mile before realizing their mistake and having to backtrack. Success gets them to the area without incident, and a raise means they find two huge, bare footprints in the soft soil near a dry creek.</p>\n<p>Once the students reach the site of the trail camera, which is tied to a tree trunk fifteen feet up, they can search the area for signs of the thing in GlenMac's photo. Allow them a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.★ Notice]{Notice} or @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Survival]{Survival} roll to search the area, but all the while the feeling of being watched grows steadily stronger. Build up the tension, then describe a line of zombies (at least four per student) shuffling down the trail with a young man at their rear. Call for a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Fear]{Fear} roll, then proceed with <em><strong>Nobody Will Ever Believe This</strong></em>, below.</p>\n<h3>NOBODY WILL EVER BELIEVE THIS</h3>\n<p>Montague panics at the sight of the study group, assuming they are either after the treasure or have come to punish him for tampering with nature. Regardless of the reason, he orders the zombies to attack and arms himself with a shovel to do the same. It's time for the Action Deck!</p>\n<p>The heroes should feel as though they are fighting a battle against overwhelming odds. Have them face off against Montague and the undead horde several rounds before introducing skunk apes into the fight. If the students cut through the attackers too easily, have a few late arrivals reach up from the ground and grapple the students by their ankles so they can't move&mdash;and adding a +1 @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Ganging Up]{gang up} bonus to any others who get into melee!</p>\n<p>During the first round of combat, have the defenders make @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.★ Notice]{Notice} rolls. Even those who fail detect brief hints of skunk ape stench. Success means the smell is more pronounced and a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Trait Rolls]{raise} hears loud rustling from the forest at their backs. On the second round of combat, the forest comes alive with rustling and a frenzy of screeches, hoots, and howls. The skunk apes are enraged at the presence of undead and are working themselves up to attack.</p>\n<p>At a dramatically appropriate moment, thrown rocks the size of bowling balls streak toward the zombies. The following round, a few skunk apes brave the clearing to go into melee with the zombies. Introduce one skunk ape into melee for every three zombies still standing. Heroes must make a Fear roll at the first sight of these cryptids, and those within range of their Stench special ability must make a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Traits]{Vigor} roll as well.</p>\n<p>Students who attack a skunk ape are attacked in turn, but otherwise the creatures ignore them in favor of their hated enemy. The skunk apes are not satisfied until the zombies have been torn limb from limb, at which point they turn menacingly on Montague for raising them. Unless the study group intervenes, the skunk apes converge on the necromancer and kill him. With the zombies gone, the students need succeed only at an @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Intimidation]{Intimidation} or @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.★ Persuasion]{Persuasion} roll to send the cryptids back into the forest.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Montague</strong>: Use the @Compendium[world.etu-bestiary.Ritualist]{Ritualist} from East Texas University, with the addition of a shovel used as a club (Str+d4).</li>\n<li><strong>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-bestiary.Zombies]{Zombies} (4/hero):</strong> Use the zombies found in Savage Worlds Deluxe.</li>\n<li><strong>@Compendium[world.etu-bestiary.Skunk Ape]{Skunk Ape}:</strong> As necessary to save the heroes.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>AFTERMATH</h3>\n<p>Once the skunk apes retreat, only the frightened Montague (perhaps) and the heroes remain. It's up to the students to decide their classmate's fate, but they would have a hard time explaining his crime to law enforcement. For his part, Montague is sufficiently traumatized that he promises never to dabble in magic again. Of course, the Dean may always draw on the @Compendium[etu-rules.etu-tables.Black Magic Corruption ]{Black Magic Corruption} table to determine whether Montague is good to his word&hellip;</p>\n<p>Any photos or video from the incident are automatically assumed to be pranks, and analysis of physical evidence comes back \"inconclusive.\"</p>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"modules/etu-adventures/icons/logo-etu.webp","_id":"OTgd137dnJSAX7EB"}

But instead of delivering his son, he hid him. The demon told @Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Emile Weinstock]{Emile} that 13 children could be sacrificed to settle the debt, so @Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Emile Weinstock]{Emile} set fire to a visiting carnival. The fire burned out of control and razed the town of Corliss. Ever since that day, Corliss rebuilds each night and the events of the day play out again&mdash;and will continue to do so until @Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Emile Weinstock]{Emile} is stopped.</p>\n<h3>A DEAL WITH OLD SCRATCH</h3>\n<p>The mill town of Corliss was founded in the Texas Piney Woods by @Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Emile Weinstock]{Emile Weinstock's}&nbsp;family company at the turn of the Twentieth Century. In 1917, the town's prosperity blossomed almost overnight. The mill's workforce grew to over 400, the town's population grew to over 2,500, and the mill churned out more than 20,000 feet of board each day. Soon Corliss had a full commissary, post office, school, town pool, doctor's office, newspaper office, ice plant, and movie theater.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Emile Weinstock]{Emile Weinstock's} choice of mill location and its prosperity in its early years were not an accident. He built the mill on a small piece of property his father had bought and ignored, one of the only things left after @Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Emile Weinstock]{Emile's} father died. The family's company had been bordering on bankruptcy, but @Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Emile Weinstock]{Emile's} father had never allowed anyone to know. @Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Emile Weinstock]{Emile} went to see if the small piece of Texas property could be of any use.</p>\n<p>When @Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Emile Weinstock]{Emile} arrived, he found a small camp in the shadow of a black pine tree. A well-dressed man in the camp introduced himself as @Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Mr. Scatch]{Mr. Scatch} and invited Emile to sit and eat. @Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Mr. Scatch]{Mr. Scatch} enthralled @Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Emile Weinstock]{Emile} with visions of prosperity &mdash; he only had to make a deal. Desperate to save the company, @Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Emile Weinstock]{Emile} signed an agreement with @Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Mr. Scatch]{Mr. Scatch} to ensure growth and prosperity. In exchange, @Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Emile Weinstock]{Emile} agreed to never harm the black pine and deliver his firstborn son to @Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Mr. Scatch]{Mr. Scatch} in 13 years. @Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Emile Weinstock]{Emile} thought he was safe; he could never have children after a long fight with mumps as a child.</p>\n<p>But when he returned home, @Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Emile Weinstock]{Emile} found his wife was pregnant and became worried about the deal. Thirteen years later, @Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Emile Weinstock]{Emile} tried to renegotiate. @Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Mr. Scatch]{Mr. Scatch} told @Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Emile Weinstock]{Emile} he could trade his son for 13 of the children of Corliss. As @Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Emile Weinstock]{Emile} searched for a way to pay his debt, a carnival arrived.</p>\n<p>On the first day of November 1930, the Caine Bros. carnival set up on the north side of the town. As the carnival set up, clowns roamed through the town handing out flyers and selling tickets to the attractions. Children and parents grew excited. They eagerly awaited the end of the workday. The Weinstock family allowed the carnival to power its lights and attractions with their mill's steam engines. The next day was declared an employee holiday, except there wouldn't be a next day: Corliss virtually disappeared overnight.</p>\n</section>\n<h3>THE SHORT CUT</h3>\n<p>After leaving @Compendium[etu-rules.etu-setting-rules.East Texas University]{East Texas University} and @Compendium[etu-rules.etu-setting-rules.Pinebox]{Pinebox} for a weekend away from tests, teachers, and studies, the students are late in returning to @Compendium[etu-rules.etu-setting-rules.East Texas University]{ETU}. They've decided to take a shortcut back to @Compendium[etu-rules.etu-setting-rules.Pinebox]{Pinebox}: an old logging road. After many twists, turns, and forks on the old road, the students find themselves lost in the backwoods. Things grow worse when the car breaks down just as sunset approaches.</p>\n<p>The heroes' cell phones have no signal in this part of the woods and they are only a couple hours away from night. A short way down the road, a dislodged signpost tilts from a pine. The paint is faded and flaking away, but the words are legible,</p>\n<p><em>\"Corliss Mill, Managed by the Weinstock Family Company, Pop. 2,613.\" </em></p>\n<p>As the students approach the sign they can see that the road turns and leads down a hill toward a large clearing&mdash; the remains of Corliss.</p>\n<h3>CORLISS</h3>\n<p>The students have a couple hours to explore Corliss before the sun sets and they find themselves in a ghostly replay of the fire that happened years before.</p>\n<p>Very little remains of Corliss. Explorers spot partial walls and collapsed roofs of homes that have been retaken by the pines. The only discernible structures are those that line the main street of Corliss.</p>\n<p>As the students walk down the hill toward Corliss they each smell the last wisps of smoke from the fire. Main Street is wide and lined with the remnants of the buildings that were once central to life in Corliss. The largest ones on Main Street are the commissary and the Rich Pines movie house. The doctor's office and post office bookend the commissary. The school sits at the end of a small lane that turns past the Rich Pines. Near the school, a small path leads to the town's swimming pool and pool house. Nearby is the stone building of the ice plant. The remains of the Corliss Mill are at the end of Main Street. At the edge of town, near the mill, sit the remains of the carnival and a massive black pine tree.</p>\n<p>As the heroes explore Corliss, the Dean should use the following building descriptions.</p>\n<h3>1.COMMISSARY</h3>\n<p>The commissary is a two-story building with a porch that wraps around the ground floor. The wood is moldy, rotting in places, and all the windows are broken. Flakes of white paint cling to the walls. The front door falls off its hinges as the handle is grasped. The ground floor is full of collapsing counters and shelves. Most of the contents of the shelves are rotted and ruined. Searching the commissary results in the characters finding three old iron crowbars and a sealed barrel of salt. There is a stack of old newspapers on one of the counters with a headline that reads, \"Country's Depression Bypasses Corliss Mill.\" The article explains that the Corliss Mill seems to have been unaffected by the Great Depression.</p>\n<h3>2.RICH PINES MOVIE HOUSE</h3>\n<p>The Rich Pines is bigger than the commissary. A large portion of it has burned and the movie house lobby counters have collapsed. Dirt and rodent droppings cover the floor and the wall behind the counter still holds a poster for the movie, \"The Doorway to Hell.\" Old paint labels the doors to the theater: Whites, Coloreds, Mexicans. The doorways labeled Coloreds and Mexicans lead up to balconies. The stairs are charred and the balcony's walkways crumble when walked on. The ceiling is missing and old chairs litter the floor.</p>\n<p>While in the theater a movie starts to play on the torn and moldy screen. The film is scratched as static plays from the disconnected speakers that didn't burn with the roof and balconies. The film is short scenes and flashes: Emile meeting @Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Mr. Scatch]{Mr. Scatch}, Corliss expanding, @Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Emile Weinstock]{Emile} standing with his son, children playing and rushing toward the carnival, @Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Emile Weinstock]{Emile} and @Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Mr. Scatch]{Mr. Scatch} arguing, and finally the fire. The fire spreads in the movie and slowly turns to color as it bursts along the walls of the theater. While the heroes try to escape, the chairs in the theater start to float and spin through the air. This is the student's first brush with Emile.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Emile Weinstock]{Emile} is not fully manifest and rolls a d6 plus a Wild Die to toss the chairs. The Dean rolls once for @Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Emile Weinstock]{Emile} each round and applies the roll to each character's @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Parry]{Parry}. The chairs are old and brittle and only deal 1d6+1 damage on a hit. Each one shatters when it strikes a student.</p>\n<p>Any hero who has a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Traits]{Spirit} score of d8 or higher sees the ghosts of the town's children darting out of the theater, beckoning the character to follow.</p>\n<p>Once back on Main Street they see the theater is no longer on fire. Those who saw the children watch them fade away in the sunlight.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>@Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Emile Weinstock]{Emile Weinstock}</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>3.DR. ABEGNALE'S OFFICE</h3>\n<p>Dr. Percival Abegnale's office is a look back at the history of medicine. Like the commissary, there is very little fire damage here. Students entering the office find shelves and cabinets intact but thrown open. The floor is littered with rotting bandages covered in decadesold blood. A surgeon's tray next to the medical bed is covered with gauze&mdash;some rolled and some bloodied.</p>\n<h3>4.POST OFFICE</h3>\n<p>The post office is missing part of its roof and a side wall from the fire. The interior is taken up by a massive counter that separates the front from the postal boxes&nbsp; and the sorting room. A glass case full of pictures of Corliss residents hangs on the wall to the left of the door. One of the pictures shows @Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Mr. Scatch]{Mr. Scatch} standing with Emile clasping hands in front of the mill. Students studying the picture see @Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Mr. Scatch]{Mr. Scatch}'s other hand is holding a folded piece of paper.</p>\n<h3>5.CORLISS PRIMARY SCHOOL</h3>\n<p>The primary school isn't much more than a scorched floor and the lower portions of the walls. Desks and chairs are scattered and each shows signs of the fire. Characters feel uneasy as the children's ghosts often congregate here. Any students wishing to cast a @Compendium[etu-rules.etu-powers.Grave Speak]{Grave Speak} uses @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Occult]{Occult} with a +2 bonus. The medium speaks with several of Corliss's children if successful:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Failure:</strong> None of the children of the town are summoned, instead attracting @Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Emile Weinstock]{Emile} who starts throwing debris around the school. The Dean rolls against all students' @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Parry]{Parry}; a hit inflicts 1d6+1 damage.</li>\n<li><strong>Success: </strong>The 13 children killed to pay the debt to @Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Mr. Scatch]{Mr. Scatch} appear and talk about the fire. They were lost in the mirrors and couldn't get out. They know that @Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Emile Weinstock]{Emile} started the conflagration, but they don't know why.</li>\n<li><strong>Raise: </strong>The 13 children and @Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Emile Weinstock]{Emile's} son Isaac are summoned. The medium gets the same info as with a success, but Isaac also tells the students @Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Emile Weinstock]{Emile} killed the children to protect him from @Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Mr. Scatch]{Mr. Scatch}.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>6.CORLISS POOL</h3>\n<p>The pool and pool house are blackened from the fire, and the pool house roof burned. The tiles of the pool house are scorched and broken. Some pieces of tile are coated in salt crystals. The tile shards act as a handful of salt when used against a ghost, but add +1d4 to the normal damage.</p>\n<h3>7.ICE PLANT</h3>\n<p>The ice plant is the only other stone building in Corliss. The building is seared and soot-covered, and the tin roof is rusted in many areas. As the students explore the ice plant, sunlight shines through holes in the roof like spotlights. The main condensing units are intact and there are drip pans still under them full of crystallized salt. The characters also find rusted ice saws and hooks.</p>\n<h3>8.THE CARNIVAL</h3>\n<p>Very little of the carnival remains to be explored. The entrance is marked by a sagging ticket stall. Characters investigating within find an old rusty sledgehammer and a roll of moldy tickets. As the students enter the carnival grounds the smell of smoke mingles with the scent of popcorn and cotton candy. Ash on the ground clings to the student's shoes. The charred remains of a Ferris wheel marks the center of the grounds. There are the remains of wagons that once caged animals, a small roller coaster track in pieces, and a house of mirrors.</p>\n<p>The rest of the carnival is unrecognizable: The cars from rides, partial walls, and rubble lay where they burned.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Emile Weinstock]{Emile} makes his presence known again in the carnival grounds. When the heroes approach the former animal cages they walk into a hot spot and the remaining cage bars glow. @Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Carnival Animal Ghosts]{Ghosts of the animals} once held there leap from the cage's remains!</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>@Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Carnival Animal Ghosts]{Carnival Animal Ghosts}:</strong> (1 per 2 students)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>9.THE BLACK PINE</h3>\n<p>As the characters approach the black pine, they are hit with the smell of sulfur and rotting meat mixed with the scent of smoke. The tree's bark and needles are black. Three iron bands are wrapped around the tree. Each band is sticky with sap dripping along the edges of the iron. If the students touch iron to the tree a small rupture appears and drips sap to the ground.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Mr. Scatch]{Mr. Scatch} is trapped in the tree. The heroes may free him by removing the iron bands from the tree. If freed, @Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Mr. Scatch]{Mr. Scatch} offers to give them all the information they need to free the town and save the children&mdash;if they are willing to make a deal.&emsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>@Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Mr. Scatch]{Mr. Scatch}</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>ENCOUNTER TABLE</h3>\n<p>For each hour the group spends in Corliss's ruins, draw a card and consult the following table to provide clues about what happened to the town. Combine each card's value with its suit to create a unique scene or event.</p>\n<p><strong>@Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-tables.Corliss Encounters]{Corliss Encounters}</strong></p>\n<h3>SUNSET IN CORLISS</h3>\n<p>Read the following to your group as the sun sets:</p>\n<section class=\"simple-block\">\n<p><em>As the sun vanishes over the horizon, the burnt smell becomes stronger and smoke starts to climb into the air from the wreckage. Buildings rebuild themselves as smoke rises. Sawdust covers the ground and fresh footprints appear. Smoke streams from each footprint as shoes, pants and dresses, and people appear. Laughter, conversations, and arguments flow as the specters become tangible. By the time the sun should have set, it instead hangs high in a bright blue sky. Corliss is whole again. </em></p>\n</section>\n<p>The students walk through Corliss as it was in 1930. The buildings are complete and the sounds of the mill can be heard through the town. The streets bustle with life. Buildings the students visited earlier are all intact and in use. The commissary is fully stocked with merchandise, people linger near the doctor's office, and the post office has people coming and going&mdash;a telegraph line runs from the roof. Corliss's people go about their day unaware of what's about to happen.</p>\n<p>At the carnival, the Ferris wheel is almost complete. Beside it, a small wooden roller coaster and carousel have been set up. Red and white tents sit here and there. Midway games are ready to go and locals have set up small food and drink carts. Lights are strung from tent to tent with signs marking the larger attractions: House of Mirrors, Haunted House, The Death Defying Devil's Dominion, and Feast of the World.</p>\n<h3>TALKING TO THE LOCALS</h3>\n<p>The students can interact with everyone in Corliss. They face questions about who they are and how they came to be there. Most of the townsfolk believe anything they are told, even though the heroes still wear their modern clothes and carry anything they had with them when the sun set. The children, @Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Mr. Scatch]{Mr. Scatch}, and @Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Emile Weinstock]{Emile} all see the characters for who they are.</p>\n<section class=\"secret\">\n<p><strong>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.★ Persuasion]{Persuasion} check:</strong> The residents give students the following pieces of information when asked, one per success and @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Trait Rolls]{raise} on a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.★ Persuasion]{Persuasion} roll.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\"Emile is a great boss; even with the stock market crash he's kept the mill running.\"</li>\n<li>\"It's amazing here.

For some reason, though, @Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Mr. Scatch]{Mr. Scatch} is allowed to live in his own little camp there.\"</li>\n<li>\"Everyone is excited for the carnival!

Normally he's skulking around town somewhere.\"</li>\n<li>\"No one has seen Emile in a while. Last I heard he was near the carnival.\"</li>\n</ul>\n</section>\n<br />\n<h3>EMILE'S PLOY</h3>\n<p>The students' presence in Corliss doesn't go unnoticed by @Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Emile Weinstock]{Emile}&mdash;they challenge his power. @Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Emile Weinstock]{Emile} knows what he's doing during each loop: His rationale is that as long as everyone's stuck in the loop, no one is dead. @Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Emile Weinstock]{Emile} doesn't understand that he is now a ghost. He doesn't even remember his own attacks on the heroes before sunset.</p>\n<p>Once they're in Corliss's past, students only have a few hours to stop the fire and break the cycle. @Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Emile Weinstock]{Emile} plans to set fire to the House of Mirrors as soon as 13 children enter the building. He's using oil-soaked pine knots to start the fire. @Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Emile Weinstock]{Emile} has been lifting the tent flaps of the House of Mirrors and tossing the pine knots inside to spread them. The oil's scent is masked by the smell of pine sawdust and turpentine. @Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Emile Weinstock]{Emile} plans to start the fire at sundown, using the mirrors to confuse the children and prevent them from escaping.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Emile Weinstock]{Emile} is found shunting the pine knots to the carnival from the mill and the characters will find him at one of those locations or moving between them. @Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Emile Weinstock]{Emile} has already imprisoned @Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Mr. Scatch]{Mr. Scatch} so he can't affect the loop that's been created. The students can free @Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Mr. Scatch]{Mr. Scatch}, if they do his offer is the same as if they freed him before the sun set.</p>\n<h3>FINAL ENCOUNTER</h3>\n<p>The heroes find @Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Emile Weinstock]{Emile} en route to the House of Mirrors, if they head directly for him. He doesn't waste time trying to fight, but instead rushes to light the fire as quickly as he can and then turns to do anything he can to stop the characters.</p>\n<p>If the students free @Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Mr. Scatch]{Mr. Scatch}, they see smoke rising in the distance. Scratch offers to help if each student makes a deal with him. @Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Mr. Scatch]{Mr. Scatch} can stop @Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Emile Weinstock]{Emile} easily&hellip;but at what cost?</p>\n<p>If the heroes take too long&mdash;in the Dean's opinion&mdash; once the sun has set they see smoke coming from the carnival. They see @Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Emile Weinstock]{Emile} hurrying away from the fire.</p>\n<p>Once the fire starts the characters have six rounds (after arriving at the fire) to stop @Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Emile Weinstock]{Emile}. They can either stop the fire from spreading or save the children. While @Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Emile Weinstock]{Emile} is still \"alive,\" none of the people of Corliss help the students. The moment the students stop Emile, they end the loop and the townsfolk rally to help them battle the blaze.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>@Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Emile Weinstock]{Emile Weinstock}</strong></li>\n<li><strong>@Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-savage-tales.CoM: Corliss on Fire]{Corliss on Fire}:&nbsp;</strong>Image to share with the heroes.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>AFTERMATH</h3>\n<p>If the heroes succeed in defeating @Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Emile Weinstock]{Emile} and saving the children, they are whisked back to Corliss in their own time. Most of the buildings are gone, but the main stretch of road remains. The commissary still stands with the post office and the doctor's office. The old movie theater has posters in its windows and the marquee holds a few crooked letters. All the buildings show the wear and tear of years of abandonment. There is no sign of the fire. Nothing suggests the place is anything more than another abandoned mill town.</p>\n<p>If @Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Mr. Scatch]{Mr. Scatch} survived, he is in a small camp next to the black pine.

However, the hideous mummy @Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Dr Franz Heimglimmer]{Dr. Heimglimmer} was content to remain in hiding and bide his time. That time has finally come. Only recently has @Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Dr Franz Heimglimmer]{Dr. Heimglimmer} summoned the remaining Black Guard together and revealed his resurrection.</p>\n<p>However, true immortality is not yet his. While hundreds of enslaved souls shield him from death, he is still trapped between the living and undeath as a mummy. That will change when he performs a dark ritual to regenerate his flesh and grant himself the true immortality he sought for most of his life. To achieve his aims, he instructed the remaining seven Black Guard to seek out the highly exotic components needed to perform the ritual.</p>\n<p>Yet, not all is well among the remaining Black Guard. One among them, Jenny Chapman*, was horrified at the creature @Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Dr Franz Heimglimmer]{Dr. Heimglimmer} became and even more-so the possibility that she would meet a similar fate. She pried the gang's contact information from Lisa Gray and hopes to use the characters to stop Heimglimmer.</p>\n<p><em>In the first edition of Last Rites, this character was named Sylvia Valruhn. She is the \"striking brunette\" in the photos found in @Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Dr Franz Heimglimmer]{Dr. Heimglimmer}'s home. If you played the 1st edition pdf, then change her name back to Sylvia Valruhn.</em></p>\n</section>\n<h3>THE BIG REVEAL</h3>\n<p>The gang's involvement begins with a call from a woman named Jenny Chapman, who claims that Lisa Gray recommended them for helping with her haunting. Allow a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Traits]{Smarts} roll to recognize her name from Last Rites (if they learned it). Jenny is paranoid about @Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Dr Franz Heimglimmer]{Dr. Heimglimmer} discovering her betrayal, so she insists on meeting somewhere private.</p>\n<p>When the sleuths meet her, they find an older, statuesque brunette who begins by confessing that she is a member of the Black Guard who wants to \"defect.\" She explains that she dated \"Frank Manz\" for a number of years, but it was only in the last few that she learned his secret. He played upon her fear of growing old and convinced her to join his Neo-Birkhuhn as a means of learning the secret to eternal youth.</p>\n<p>She explains that their encounter in @Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Dr Franz Heimglimmer]{Dr. Heimglimmer}'s house stopped Lisa Gray's haunting but created an even greater monster. Revinowitz and Martinez had turned on the Nazi, blocking his access to the spirits that kept him alive. When the cultists were defeated, @Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Dr Franz Heimglimmer]{Dr. Heimglimmer} regained control of the souls and used them to resurrect his body as a mummy. For Jenny, the lure of eternal youth and beauty has been replaced by the reality of becoming an undying, hideous monster.</p>\n<p>The frightened cultist says that the mummy has set up court in Irwin Revinowitz's former85 home, but until @Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Dr Franz Heimglimmer]{Dr. Heimglimmer} is denied the source of his power he is unkillable. She warns that the mummy seeks to complete his mastery over the enslaved souls, gaining true immortality. For now, each soul is bound to @Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Dr Franz Heimglimmer]{Dr. Heimglimmer} by a personal item&mdash;a \"fetish.\" Unfortunately, after his betrayal the mummy learned his lesson and split his trove of enslaved souls into three hidden caches. To defeat the Nazi doctor, these caches must be recovered and the souls released from bondage.</p>\n<p>Jenny has only deduced the location of one of the caches, but she hopes to gather more clues from within @Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Dr Franz Heimglimmer]{Dr. Heimglimmer}'s Neo-Birkhuhn. The first cache of fetishes is located in shed 27 of the @Compendium[etu-rules.etu-setting-rules.ITS-A-LOCK]{ITS-A-LOCK} mini-storage facility the heroes visited in @Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-savage-tales.Curse of the Black Guard]{Curse of the Black Guard}.</p>\n<h3>EVIL STORAGE</h3>\n<p>After the messy battle from @Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-savage-tales.Curse of the Black Guard]{Curse of the Black Guard}, the @Compendium[etu-rules.etu-setting-rules.ITS-A-LOCK]{ITS-A-LOCK} owner made a token effort at appearing more secure. The characters must make a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.★ Stealth]{Stealth} roll to evade a roaming security guard who patrols the property on a golf cart. The shed can be opened with a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Thievery]{Thievery} &ndash;1 roll or with the assistance of bolt cutters and a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Traits]{Strength} roll &ndash;2.</p>\n<p>The cache of fetishes is hidden in plain sight within the Nazi's 10&times;10 storage unit. A large clear glass vase contains a collection of knickknacks, from locks of hair to spectacles. Each item, numbering in the dozens, represents a single soul enslaved by @Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Dr Franz Heimglimmer]{Dr. Heimglimmer}. Breaking or destroying the item breaks @Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Dr Franz Heimglimmer]{Dr. Heimglimmer}'s link and frees the soul.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, @Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Dr Franz Heimglimmer]{Dr. Heimglimmer} panics as soon as he feels himself weaken. Since he does not know which cache was disturbed, he sends a pair of his Neo-Birkhuhn to each. If the heroes destroy the fetishes at the mini-storage, a pair of cultists arrive shortly thereafter and attack on sight. These are @Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Dr Franz Heimglimmer]{Dr. Heimglimmer}'s more fanatical Neo-Birkhuhn, who fight until dead or incapacitated.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>@Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Neo-Birkhuhn]{Neo-Birkhuhn} (2): Use the Ritualist Extra found in East Texas University, adding the following gear: Zippo Lighter from Hell (burst talisman from East Texas University) and Colt 1911 pistol (Range 12/24/48, Damage 2d6+1, RoF 1, Shots 7, AP 1)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>HE'S ONTO US</h3>\n<p>Jenny calls the gang shortly after the battle's conclusion. @Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Dr Franz Heimglimmer]{Dr. Heimglimmer} called her, both furious and frightened.

She instructs the heroes to retrieve the second set of fetishes and bring them to her house for a counter-ritual against @Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Dr Franz Heimglimmer]{Dr. Heimglimmer}.</p>\n<p>The fetishes are where Jenny describes, although you may add a trap to the mausoleum (such as quicksand based upon the <em>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-powers.Entangle]{entangle}</em> power) to further challenge the heroes.</p>\n<h3>JUSTICE</h3>\n<p>When the heroes arrive at Jenny's home, they find her murdered corpse.

Stretched out upon the kitchen table is a crude sculpture of a man made from a mixture of clay and dark, rich graveyard soil. Its forehead is marked by a series of Hebrew letters. Those with Language (Hebrew) or a successful @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Research]{Research} roll decipher the word \"Justice.\"</p>\n<p>A @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Occult]{Occult} roll allows the heroes to identify this figure as a @Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Golem]{golem}.

With a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Occult]{Occult} &ndash;1 roll or a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Traits]{Smarts} &ndash;2 roll to recollect Jenny's last phone call, the heroes deduce that they should take the fetishes she asked them to save and place them within the cavity. Doing so and covering the cavity with more dirt completes the ritual, allowing the @Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Golem]{golem} to animate. The @Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Golem]{golem} arises from the kitchen table and silently plods out of the house. It pays no attention to the heroes, but only follows its own internal instinct to take the closest path to its goal.</p>\n<p>Should the heroes not find the @Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Golem]{golem} or choose to destroy the fetishes instead, the mummy is still weakened but does not have the distraction of the golem's attack.</p>\n<h3>SHOWDOWN</h3>\n<p>Since Jenny told them that the mummy was at Revinowitz's house, the heroes should have little question as to their next destination. If in doubt they can follow the golem's trail.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Dr Franz Heimglimmer]{Dr. Heimglimmer} and his four remaining NeoBirkhuhn have begun gathering power for the immortality ritual in the pool house at the rear of the property. Central to the ritual is the small pile of soul fetishes (the final third). If the heroes successfully animated the @Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Golem]{golem}, it disrupts the process upon its arrival (see \"@Compendium[etu-rules.etu-setting-rules.Casting Ritual Magic]{Casting Ritual Magic}\" in the The Dean's List chapter of East Texas University). If the @Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Golem]{golem} was not animated then the heroes must distract the ritualists and obtain the fetishes.</p>\n<p>The final encounter is a straight up fight. Unfortunately, as long as even some of his fetishes remain, @Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Dr Franz Heimglimmer]{Dr. Heimglimmer} regenerates at an alarming rate. Only once the fetishes are destroyed can the mummy be killed once and for all.</p>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"modules/etu-adventures/icons/logo-etu.webp","_id":"ptToEbcsC94sahjh"}
{"name":"My Little Friends","permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_8yb3o2dk6cw","path":"Savage Tales#/CF_SEP/Degrees of Horror","color":"#000000"}},"content":"<div class=\"swade-core\">\n<div class=\"section-header\">\n<h1>My Little Friends</h1>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p><em>A professor's death by insect attack hearkens back to an old adversary. </em></p>\n<p><strong>Follows:</strong> Bugs</p>\n<p><strong>Recommended: </strong>Juniors or Seniors</p>\n<p><strong>Location:</strong> Life Sciences building on the way to class</p>\n<section class=\"ridged-block-float\">\n<h3>BACKGROUND</h3>\n<p>Frustrated at his Entomology professor's high esteem for Johnny Chafe, graduate student Eddie Ruiz stole a notebook from his rival. Later, he realized the journal contained Chafe's chemical formula for bestowing mental control over insects. Thinking to capitalize on the discovery, Ruiz perfected the drug by separating specific insect DNA and recombining it with Chafe's feeding compound. Unlike the original formula, Eddie's version is administered directly to the bloodstream.</p>\n<p>Eddie has taken the serum for more than two weeks and begun suffering from paranoia over his secret being stolen. He thinks his formula will win him accolades from the scientific community, and by \"scientific community\" he means the attractive Dr. Sheila West. Naturally, he was crushed to learn that Dr. West had begun dating her colleague Dr. Lyle Canton. Worse, he realized that the new formula was changing him into a bizarre, insect-humanoid. With his sanity slipping and his powers over other insects blossoming, the graduate student took matters into his own hands to make Dr. West his \"queen.\"</p>\n</section>\n<h3>THE STING</h3>\n<p>The adventure begins as one or more of the sleuths make their way to class in the Life Sciences building on a Monday morning. A shriek rings out from down the hall and gawkers quickly form near a professor's office doorway. Inside lies the gruesome body of Entomology professor Dr. Lyle Canton, covered in hundreds of insect bites and stings. A search of the office fails to reveal more than a few harmless insects still secure in their terrariums. A relevant Knowledge roll such as @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Healing]{Healing} or a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Traits]{Smarts} &ndash;2 roll reveals that the poor professor appeared to have died early in the weekend.</p>\n<h3>AN OLD FRIEND</h3>\n<p>If the characters played Bugs, this should be enough to alert the students that either Johnny Chafe has returned or someone else has continued his experiments. If Chafe is still alive and at ETU, he answers their questions upon a successful @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.★ Persuasion]{Persuasion} roll. His disposition toward the characters greatly depends upon how they resolved Bugs, so adjust the difficulty accordingly. With a raise, Johnny also discloses the missing notebook and a suspicion that it was stolen.</p>\n<h3>INVESTIGATION</h3>\n<p>A visit to the ETU Insectary and a successful @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Networking]{Networking} roll reveals that Dr. Sheila West and her graduate student, Eddie Ruiz, failed to appear to give a lecture. With a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Trait Rolls]{raise}, they also learn that Ruiz had a crush on his professor.</p>\n<p>The addresses of both can be found with a little time on the Internet and a successful @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Research]{Research} roll. Ruiz lives in a one bedroom, second floor apartment. Breaking in requires a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Thievery]{Thievery} roll, or the door has a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Characters]{Toughness} of 8 if they want to @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Breaking Things]{kick it in}. The apartment is unoccupied other than countless insects which scurry across the floors, walls, and ceiling. If the students enter, they should make a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Fear]{Fear} roll from all the scuttling insects. The apartment offers no clue as to Ruiz's current whereabouts, but a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.★ Notice]{Notice} &ndash;2 roll reveals strange shapes reminiscent of armor plating discarded on the floor. A @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Science]{Science} roll -2 allows the student to identify these as abnormally large molted exoskeleton.</p>\n<h3>THE QUEEN</h3>\n<p>Dr. West lives in a brick home in upscale @Compendium[etu-rules.etu-setting-rules.Timberland Village]{Timberland Village}, a gated community off @Compendium[etu-rules.etu-setting-rules.Lake Greystone]{Lake Greystone} favored by better-paid ETU professors and administrators. An older, compact economy car is parked in the driveway but no one answers the front door. A @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.★ Notice]{Notice}&nbsp; &ndash;1 roll reveals a spare key hidden above the door frame. Alternately, the front door can be opened with a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Thievery]{Thievery} &ndash;1 roll. The backyard patio door can be opened with a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Thievery]{Thievery} roll, or the glass broken with any successful attack (Parry 2). Students forcing their way in should make a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.★ Stealth]{Stealth} roll to avoid a call to the police from observant neighbors.</p>\n<p>As at Eddie's apartment, Dr. West's house is infested with all manner of crawling and flying insects. The creature that had once been Eddie Ruiz is biding his time inside, watching the cocoon that holds the unlucky Dr. West. Eddie attacks as soon as he notices the heroes. He has grown an exoskeleton, large eyes, and two sucker-like fangs. He can also control up to 2 swarms.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-bestiary.Swarm]{Swarm} (2): </strong>As in the Savage Worlds rulebook.</li>\n<li><strong>@Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Incest Chimera]{Incest Chimera}:</strong> Eddie Ruiz</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>CONCLUSION</h3>\n<p>Attempts to publicize Eddie's transformation are dismissed as another lame college hoax.</p>\n<p>If the heroes rescue Dr. West, the cocoon breaks easily and she awakens in two days. (Use Professor from East Texas University if necessary.) She checks out okay, but secretly has not survived unchanged. Dr. West can now control insects as well, though she suffers none of Eddie's mental problems and means no one harm.</p>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"modules/etu-adventures/icons/logo-etu.webp","_id":"r7iF1yXq2mL96eAz"}
