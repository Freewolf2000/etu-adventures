A week later her body was discovered by hikers off a rural road but the murder was never solved. The child's mother couldn't deal with the loss and committed suicide, while her father turned to alcohol, eventually losing his job and being evicted.</p>\n<p>Now Niles Henry has struck again, taking a ten year old named Dawn Ramirez from the elementary school playground. Police issued an Amber Alert, but after two days still have no leads. Niles hasn't killed Dawn yet, but he will do so in two more days. Christa's spirit has returned in an attempt to save Dawn from her fate and to bring her murderer to justice.</p>\n<h2>LOST</h2>\n<p>As the students return from a trip outside @Compendium[etu-rules.etu-setting-rules.Pinebox]{Pinebox}, characters who make a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.★ Notice]{Notice} roll spot a little girl with long brunette hair and a sad face standing on the empty roadside. With a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Trait Rolls]{raise}, they also notice the girl's torn, blood-stained pink blouse.</p>\n<p>Every student must make @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Traits]{Spirit} rolls, and the one with the highest roll hears a girl's voice say <em>\"Help me. Help her.\"</em> As the car whizzes past, she turns and disappears into the forest.</p>\n<p>If the students decide to ignore the ghost and keep driving, three days later they hear that a girl's body has been discovered in roughly that area. If appropriate to your campaign, Christa reaches out again once Niles chooses a third victim.</p>\n<p>If the sleuths stop, they find no sign of the girl. However, they do find tattered yellow crime scene tape wrapped around some trees and decayed remains of a small funeral wreath (left by Christa's mother). A successful @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.★ Common Knowledge]{Common Knowledge} roll (&ndash;2) allows the student to remember hearing about a child's body being found a little over a year ago.</p>\n<h2>A HISTORY LESSON</h2>\n<p>A successful @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Research]{Research} roll reveals the public details of Christa's abduction and murder. Police noted at the time that in such cases the victim often knew the assailant, but no suspects were ever arrested. The article also notes the address of the home where the abduction took place, and a raise reveals that Christa's mother, Janie, committed suicide three months later.</p>\n<p>Peter Levens' own self-destructive slide isn't documented in the newspaper, but with a successful @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Networking]{Networking} roll &ndash;2 roll the sleuth learns that he can be found in @Compendium[etu-rules.etu-setting-rules.Pinebox]{Pinebox's} small homeless shelter. Meeting Peter serves little purpose but to upset him.</p>\n<p>A @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.★ Common Knowledge]{Common Knowledge} &nbsp;roll indicates that the hero has heard the current Amber Alert for an abduction similar to the one they are investigating.</p>\n<h2>THE LEVENS HOUSE</h2>\n<p>Today Christa's former home sits vacant, a weathered \"For Sale\" punctuating the overgrown front yard. Niles Henry lives diagonally across the street. He keeps his latest victim, Dawn, in a small hidden room beneath the kitchen floor rug.</p>\n<p>When the students investigate the Levens home, allow another @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.★ Notice]{Notice} roll. The highest result sees movement in the house, as if someone passed in front of a bedroom window. If the gang wishes to investigate, the house can be entered with a successful @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Thievery]{Thievery} roll. @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Breaking Things]{Alternately}, windows break on any successful attack (@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Parry]{Parry} 2) and doors have a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Characters]{Toughness} of 8, but the characters must also pass a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.★ Stealth]{Stealth} roll to avoid a call to the police by concerned neighbors.</p>\n<p>Allow the sleuths to search for several minutes, then have Christa's phantom manifest near a front window. (Fear roll!) The ghost does not speak, but points through a window to Niles Henry's house and shakes her head sadly before vanishing from sight. Students who look through the window see Niles Henry carrying groceries into his home. Ten minutes later he turns on classical music very loudly (to drown out any cries or screams from Dawn).</p>\n<p><strong>Christa:</strong> Use the ghost from East Texas University for Christa, if needed.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>Even without evidence, the police are required to check out any tips regarding murder or kidnapping. If the students contact the police before the 48 hours is up, the authorities find Dawn Ramirez's backpack in Niles Henry's house, leading to her rescue.</p>\n<p>If the students cross the street to take matters into their own hands or seek more evidence, a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.★ Notice]{Notice} &ndash;2 roll reveals Dawn's faint shouts over the loud music. Niles answers the front door for no one but the police, but the rolls for breaking into Niles Henry's home are identical to the ones for Christa's. Inside the house, Dawn's cries can be heard without a penalty to the @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.★ Notice]{Notice} roll. Realizing his danger, Niles immediately attacks any intruders.</p>\n<p>Dawn's rescue leads to a $2,500 Crimestoppers reward and the good will of law enforcement, who for the next adventure respond one level better on the Reaction Table (see Savage Worlds) than they otherwise would.</p>\n</div>\n</div>","_id":"O5KhNrK64y01bkg8"}
