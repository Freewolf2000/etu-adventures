The caster must have the ability to use the power imbued. He then gathers the required components for both powers and conducts the ritual. The Power Point cost is equal to 5 plus the cost of the power being imbued. Creating an <em>amulet of @Compendium[etu-rules.etu-powers.alP0q7NQqKcNual4]{grant Edge}</em>, for example, costs 8 Power Points.</p>\n<p>When imbuing powers with variable effects, the exact use, which always occurs whenever the talisman is activated, must be determined when the ritual is performed. A talisman with @Compendium[etu-rules.etu-powers.alP0q7NQqKcNual4]{grant edge} always grants the same Edge, one with <em>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-powers.L4IbjoPtoc58262W]{boost/lower Trait}</em> always boosts or lowers the same Trait, and one firing a 3d6 @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-powers.TbcqRtdavoGl7niL]{bolt}<em>&nbsp;</em>can&rsquo;t fire a single or multiple 2d6 bolts instead.</p>\n<p>During creation of the talisman, it must also be given an activation word, phrase, action, or gesture by the ritualist. This becomes a permanent part of the talisman. Discovering the activation trigger of an unknown talisman must be done through research or trial-and-error.</p>\n<p>Creating a talisman is serious business that takes every bit of a character&rsquo;s will to transfer immense magical power into a physical object.

To activate a talisman, the character must perform the trigger and make a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Traits]{Spirit} roll as if it were his arcane skill roll. The penalty is equal to half the Power Points the power normally requires, rounded down. The <em>@Compendium[etu-rules.etu-powers.alP0q7NQqKcNual4]{grant Edge}</em> power, for example, normally requires 3 Power Points. An <em>amulet of&nbsp;@Compendium[etu-rules.etu-powers.alP0q7NQqKcNual4]{grant Edge}&nbsp;</em>thus requires a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Traits]{Spirit} roll at &ndash;1 (half of the 3 Power Points&nbsp;<em>@Compendium[etu-rules.etu-powers.alP0q7NQqKcNual4]{grant Edge}</em>&nbsp;requires).</p>\n<p>A success or @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Trait Rolls]{raise} works as usual for the power invoked.

The caster must have the ability to use the power imbued. He then gathers the required components for both powers and conducts the ritual. The Power Point cost is equal to 5 plus the cost of the power being imbued.

To activate a talisman, the character must perform the trigger and make a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Traits]{Spirit} roll as if it were his arcane skill roll. The penalty is equal to half the Power Points the power normally requires, rounded down. The <em>@Compendium[etu-rules.etu-powers.alP0q7NQqKcNual4]{grant Edge}</em> power, for example, normally requires 3 Power Points.
