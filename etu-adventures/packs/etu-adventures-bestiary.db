They actively work to remove any other bruja daring to enter what they consider their city.</p>\n<p>Dark tales of brujas and their sinister deeds are legion throughout the Southwest. According to Mexican folklore, brujas are deformed, perverse night dwellers who make use of evil magic and feed on the blood of the weak and helpless. At a distance, they appear as an elderly woman but a closer look reveals them as twisted, gnarled, and predatory. Brujas are malevolent witches who practice black magic. To survive, they consume the blood of children or lost travelers.
