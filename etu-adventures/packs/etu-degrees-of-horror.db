The students reunite with Jackson Green, who fills in some gaps about Sweet Heart's true goal and solicits their help in shutting down project Super Human. Jackson's plan involves a simultaneous sabotage of two vulnerable points, assuring success even if one group fails. While on site, the characters learn the date of the Convergence&mdash;three days after graduation. </em></p>\n<section class=\"ridged-block-float\">\n<h3>BACKGROUND</h3>\n<p>Immediately after escaping the Needler attack in his house, a scared and injured Jackson Green went into hiding and has been quietly probing into Helen's background, her connection to the chupacabra, and the extent of his old mentor GlenMac's involvement.</p>\n<p>Over time, he ferreted out Helen's connection to the Sweet Heart Foundation, some of the company's schemes, and the existence of a second Convergence. He surmises that Helen and her cohorts are ushering in this new Convergence in a bid at world conquest. The chupacabra creatures and the various incarnations of the Super Human project&mdash; aka \"Sweet Heart\"&mdash;all seem to lead to a goal of creating an unstoppable army.</p>\n<p>That belief was firmly reinforced when he discovered that Sweet Heart had brokered a federal grant to research \"human combatant enhancement\" and was awarded the use of the old Base X military outpost for private research. Jackson has spent nearly a year camped in the Big Thicket spying upon the base. He even rescued a project Super Human reject&mdash;a chupacabra hybrid runt that survived a botched execution. Since being nursed back to health, the intelligent but mute \"Paul\" has served as Jackson's near-invisible eyes and ears both on campus and off. Now, Sweet Heart appears to be near success and Jackson is ready to make his move. Only, he needs a little help&hellip;</p>\n</section>\n<h3>THE BIG REVEAL</h3>\n<p>Early one evening, each student gets a text message from an unrecognized number. <em>\"2nite ur ?s will b answered. Meet @ nature trl west side of campus. 10 pm. Don't B seen.\"</em> A few moments later, a second message follows. <em>\"Bring Pizza Barn lrg supreme.\"</em></p>\n<p>As promised, at 10 pm the silhouette of a stranger appears in the shadows beyond the well-lit head of the nature trail leading into the Big Thicket. The stranger is \"@Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Paul]{Paul},\" dressed in a t-shirt and baggy pair of sweat pants with a cap pulled low to further hide its face in shadow. The shadow beckons them to follow, and he leads them swiftly and silently down the trail. Eventually they arrive at a clear-cut right-of-way used for power transmission lines. Their guide is nowhere to be seen, but a battered jeep sits idling, its headlights turned off. A very lean and bedraggled @Compendium[etu-rules.etu-bestiary.Jackson Green]{Jackson Green} sits at the wheel.</p>\n<p>Their old friend wears ripped camouflage clothing, worn boots, and doesn't appear to have shaved in several months. Even his trademark cowboy hat is crumpled. By way of greeting, he asks if the heroes brought the pizza and tears into whatever food they offer.</p>\n<p>On the reckless drive back to his base camp over logging trails and cleared fence lines, Jackson explains the events leading up to his disappearance, the revelation about GlenMac's betrayal, what he knows about the first Convergence from President Nelson, and the investigation into Sweet Heart. While he refers to \"an ally on campus,\" he refuses to share President Nelson's name, saying \"It's not my secret to tell.\"</p>\n<h3>THE JOB</h3>\n<p>Having arrived at a primitive campsite with at least some of their questions answered, Jackson now asks for their help. His spying on Base X revealed a systematic program for creating larger and stronger chupacabras. With that explanation, Jackson introduces \"Paul,\" who drops his camouflage and appears at the edge of camp. Together they learned that thousands of incubation vats have been installed on @Compendium[etu-rules.etu-setting-rules.Base 10 Military Base]{Base X} and that Sweet Heart has already begun incubating an army of larger, stronger chupacabra hybrids.</p>\n<p>Jackson believes that the base&mdash;and Sweet Heart&mdash;is politically protected. Two separate attempts to publicly expose Sweet Heart were almost instantly and thoroughly squashed. He's not suicidal; he knows that a direct fight is a losing proposition. However, sabotage is a different matter. He and Paul identified ways to disrupt the incubation system before the army can be fully grown. Although it sounds dangerous, the facility is only staffed with a skeleton crew. Because he'll only get one chance, Jackson's plan is for two groups to hit both weak points simultaneously, doubling the odds for success. One group will introduce a poison into the incubator water system while the other group tampers with the temperature regulator. Jackson lets his friends pick which target they want to attack and how the groups will be split. He even provides printed diagrams of a standard Titan 1 missile base layout (easily found online) to use for planning.</p>\n<p>Although their old friend is open to suggestions on the particulars of the mission, he is adamant about attacking the very next evening. He resists allowing anyone to leave his campsite for fear of Sweet Heart being alerted, but he agrees to send Paul back into @Compendium[etu-rules.etu-setting-rules.Pinebox]{Pinebox} before sunrise if the gang needs certain supplies or a specific item.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>@Compendium[etu-rules.etu-bestiary.Jackson Green]{Jackson Green}:</strong> see Jackson Green in East Texas University</li>\n<li><strong>@Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Paul]{Paul}:</strong> Use the Chupacabra Hybrid on page 95, with the addition of being a Wild Card with the Lame Hindrance and Size -1.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>STEALTH TIME</h3>\n<p>Infiltrators must overcome the recently restored outer fence, skirt an obstacle course Jackson calls the chupacabra proving grounds, and dodge security cameras. Once near the silos, they must sneak into the tunnel network. The main entrance is a concrete stairwell adjacent to the above-ground barracks. A security camera points directly at the door, so their first task is disabling or tricking it. Opening the door requires @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Thievery]{Thievery} &ndash;2. The air handling system offers an alternative route large enough to accommodate a person but is full of spinning propellers. The emergency exits mentioned later in Plan B are reinforced and may only be opened from the inside.</p>\n<h3>SOMEBODY'S POISONED THE WATERHOLE</h3>\n<p>Jackson provides a canister of poison to the team sabotaging the incubator water supply. The incubators require a constant flow of water, which is enhanced with project Super Human drugs and sprayed as a fine mist to be absorbed by the chupacabra eggs.</p>\n<p>The poison team must sneak into the underground Power House, which controls both power generation and water filtration. The characters encounter a technician inside the noisy Power House performing maintenance. Since only a handful of Sweet Heart insiders are privy to the&nbsp;&nbsp;@Compendium[etu-rules.etu-setting-rules.Base 10 Military Base]{Base X} operation and they all know one another, it requires a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.★ Persuasion]{Persuasion} &ndash;2 roll to bluff past the technician.</p>\n<p>Once past the technician, the heroes must identify the filtration system (@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Science]{Science}, @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Repair]{Repair}, or similar) remove one of the replaceable filters, pour in poison, then return the system to service. The poison takes roughly thirty minutes to kill the growing chupacabras. Unfortunately, just as they complete their task (if not before), an alarm sounds throughout the underground base. Proceed to Plan B on page 43.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Sweet Heart @Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Technican]{Technican} (1):</strong> Use Cultist Extra in East Texas University, replacing dagger with a large wrench (Str+d6).</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>IS IT HOT IN HERE, OR IS IT ME?</h3>\n<p>The incubating chupacabras require a moist, hot environment such as the one in the greenhouse when the students killed their first creature. The group who targets the temperature control system must find an unattended computer or use their own portable computer to access a wired outlet and change the temperature settings. With a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.★ Notice]{Notice} roll, the team can locate a network jack in a silo (see Plan B for silo descriptions), where they also encounter a Sweet Heart technician. Using their own computer to access the network requires a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Hacking]{Hacking} roll &ndash;2 or @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Research]{Research} &ndash;4.</p>\n<p>The Sweet Heart computer with the most direct access is found in the most dangerous location&mdash;the former missile base Control Center. The Control Center is a two story bunker with updated living and working quarters. The work area on the upper level includes network servers, a large TV displaying feeds from half a dozen security cameras placed in the silos, and a laboratory. Six off-duty Sweet Heart technicians lounge in the lower level living quarters. The students must fight or bluff their way past a working technician without alerting the rest of the base in order to access the server.</p>\n<p>No matter how the heroes access the network, once logged in the hacker is presented with a directory of available options. One is a directory tree labeled \"project Super Human\" files, with subdirectories detailing the chimera experiments, the Fenris virus, Dr. Perry's genetic experiments, and many more.</p>\n<p>Multiple fail-safes prevent the incubators from being shut down, but the characters can change the temperature setting. Although it takes a while for them to completely die, the developmental damage caused in the first hour makes the chupacabras useless for Sweet Heart's purposes.</p>\n<p>As heroes are finishing up, an alert pops up on the screen reading \"Convergence simulation 9,361 complete. Play now? Yes / No\" Choosing \"Yes\" plays an animation of ley lines over @Compendium[etu-rules.etu-setting-rules.Golan County]{Golan County} warping and converging over @Compendium[etu-rules.etu-setting-rules.Pinebox]{Pinebox}. The map detail isn't precise enough to show an exact epicenter but it appears to be somewhere over campus. The running date in the bottom corner ends in May three days after graduation.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Sweet Heart @Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Technican]{Technican} (1):</strong> Use Cultist Extra from East Texas University, replacing the pistol with a Stun Gun used to keep unruly chupacabras in line.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>PLAN B</h3>\n<p>As the heroes complete their assignment, if not a little before, a general alarm sounds throughout the complex. A Sweet Heart psychic has sensed trouble and alerted the crew to seal the entrance, trapping the students underground. At the sound of the alarm, the technicians arm themselves from a weapons locker in the living quarters. They then move in teams to secure the Power House and Control Center, dogging the heavy-duty doors behind them. Meanwhile, in one of the former propellant terminals adjacent to a silo, the pack of improved chupacabras (one for each character) stir from slumber in their lair and go on the hunt. Considering the missile base's shape, they most likely encounter their prey in the long tunnel between the entrance and one of the silos. They fight to the death.</p>\n<p>According to Jackson's map, the only other way out is via an old crew emergency exit adjacent to each silo. These doors are old and firmly sealed from the inside, but usable.</p>\n<p>The most direct route to an emergency exit takes the students directly through a silo, where they get a first-hand look at the nascent Sweet Heart army. Rack-mounted incubators completely line the silo walls, stretching into the darkness above and below. A ramp in the silo's center spirals in both directions, providing access to each three foot tall device. Glass windows within the incubators show a fine mist falling over a bristled, football-sized egg.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Sweet Heart @Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Technican]{Technican} (4):</strong> Use Cultist Extra in East Texas University, sans dagger.</li>\n<li><strong>@Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Improved Chupacabra Pack Leader]{Improved Chupacabra Pack Leader} (1):</strong> The creature's pack leader is especially tough.

He asks them to map out the ley lines and figure out where the Convergence is likely to take place and notify him through the same number he used to text them. Finally, he makes the heroes promise that they won't let on that they know GlenMac's secret. At the moment their old mentor is their best shot at learning more about Sweet Heart. The haggard former grad student parts ways with his friends, but not before warning them that the worst is yet to come. Helen and the rest of Sweet Heart will be ruthless to complete their conquest.</p>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"modules/etu-adventures/icons/logo-etu.webp","_id":"3FcBjzHdkNXEIFJF"}

Unfortunately, they must first fight their way through the reawakened demon army destroyed at the Burn. In the underground bunker, Helen makes her case for mass murder and gives the heroes a chance to join them. </em></p>\n<section class=\"ridged-block-float\">\n<h3>BACKGROUND</h3>\n<p>With the Super Human army crippled, Sweet Heart resorts to fighting the Convergence with magic. The ritual utilizes De La Garza's Cross, the dimensional visualizer, and the blue lens from the Lantern of the Deep to magnify Helen's original ritual that created the Burn. This time, she purposefully intends on sacrificing the thousands of students and families attending ETU's graduation ceremonies to fuel her spell and end the Convergence for good.</p>\n<p>The ritual is planned directly beneath the ETU graduation ceremonies in the \"abandoned\" supercollider tunnels beneath the football stadium. The sacrificial ritual begins at sunrise the morning of graduation, building throughout the day and climaxing near the end of graduation ceremonies.</p>\n</section>\n<h3>MAPPING</h3>\n<p>At the end of the previous adventure, Jackson asked the heroes to map the ley lines and predict where Helen and Sweet Heart will make them converge. Mapping three separate ley lines should be sufficient to reveal that the lines converge near the @Compendium[etu-rules.etu-setting-rules.The Raven's Nest]{The Raven's Nest} football stadium. @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Research]{Research} into the stadium (with prompting by Jackson, if necessary) reveals its genesis over the unfinished constructions of a supercollider project. For more on the supercollider project, see \"@Compendium[etu-rules.etu-setting-rules.The Raven's Nest]{The Raven's Nest}\" entry under ETU Places of Note in @Compendium[etu-rules.etu-setting-rules.East Texas University]{East Texas University}.</p>\n<h3>GRADUATION DAY</h3>\n<p>For those who passed their final exams, it's graduation day. The heroes' families are in town for the big evening ceremony, adding an extra flavor of chaos to festivities. Jackson contacts the heroes mid-morning and admits that he has been unable to find anything new about Sweet Heart's plans for the Convergence. It's time to confront @Compendium[etu-rules.etu-bestiary.Glenmac]{GlenMac} directly. To this end, he asks that they join him and plead with his old mentor. This encounter should be timed such that they do not find GlenMac until late afternoon, providing extra urgency for the events that follow.</p>\n<p>When the heroes confront him, @Compendium[etu-rules.etu-bestiary.Glenmac]{GlenMac} reacts first with anger and denial. He genuinely believes that the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few. Even so, with @Compendium[etu-rules.etu-setting-rules.Pinebox]{Pinebox's} sacrifice at hand he has found his resolution wavering. Unless the heroes skip straight to violence, this encounter becomes a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Social Conflict]{Social Conflict}. Given the chance, @Compendium[etu-rules.etu-bestiary.Glenmac]{GlenMac} tries to justify his duplicity and explains Sweet Heart's true purpose&mdash; not to usher in the Convergence but to stop it (+2 @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.★ Persuasion]{Persuasion} that round). He explains how Helen designed the supercollider to focus the magic of De La Garza's Cross through the blue lens of the Lantern of the Deep and into Lilly Boatwright's dimensional visualizer. However, even with the artifacts, only a mass human sacrifice can generate sufficient magical energy to restore the converging ley lines to their natural positions. Helen's new Burn&mdash;centered right on the ETU campus&mdash; will provide the energy necessary for preventing a far greater apocalypse.</p>\n<p>This confrontation has the potential to be a defining moment for the heroes, so roleplay it to the fullest. If the students can redeem GlenMac then not only do they win the battle with their virtues intact, but his renewed alliance gives them a better chance at stopping Helen's ritual and finding another way to stop the Convergence. GlenMac insists on accompanying the heroes, needing to make up for his part in Sweet Heart's schemes.</p>\n<p>If instead the heroes cast aside any pretense at virtue and force the information from him, then they learn only the essentials of how to find and use the secret elevator. In this case, they do not benefit from GlenMac's further help.</p>\n<p>In either case, when persuaded GlenMac hands over a control key to the elevator serving the enclosed alumni boxes overlooking the stadium. The same elevator also extends down all the way to a bunker adjacent to the supercollider tunnel.</p>\n<h3>THE BURN IS ALIVE</h3>\n<p>GlenMac receives a call on his cell phone while in the heroes' presence. Another of Helen's occultists tells him that the Burn has come alive. With the Convergence imminent, the lingering demonic spirits created new material vessels from the Burn's ashes and are marching toward Pinebox. Helen fears that the demons might derail Sweet Heart's ritual by slaughtering the intended victims before they can be properly sacrificed. Most of the primary site's security detail and ritualists are being diverted to fight a delaying action against the ash demons. GlenMac is to immediately return and help Helen with the sacrificial ritual.</p>\n<p>Now that they know how to enter the Sweet Heart bunker, the heroes can begin the assault at any time. This would be the ideal time to summon allies and fully equip. By the time the heroes arrive at the stadium, their classmates and families have already begun filing in for graduation. At your discretion, the heroes encounter a few familiar faces along the way, possibly bringing closure to earlier encounters.</p>\n<p>The alumni boxes are unused during the graduation ceremonies, leaving this part of the stadium relatively empty. Shortly after the heroes enter a roped-off section of hallway by the elevator, an ash demon stomps around the corner from the opposite direction. This creature broke past Sweet Heart's defenses and seeks the growing magical energies it senses below ground. Ignoring the heroes, it rushes to the elevator where it is met by a suddenly-visible chupacabra hybrid. This creature was the successful experiment Sweet Heart had tried to mass produce at Base X. Now only this ultimate specimen remains, tasked with guarding the elevator entrance. The creatures grasp and claw at one another, sending up puffs of ash from the demon \"body.\" As long as they battle one another, the creatures largely ignore the heroes. This presents an opportunity to slip past to the elevator or to fight the victor after it has been worn down. GlenMac cannot command the chupacabra hybrid, but it obeys \"Paul\" if the lame creature is present.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>@Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Ash Demon]{Ash Demon} (1): </strong>Use &uuml;berdemon found in East Texas University with the addition of Weakness (Water): +d6 damage.</li>\n<li><strong>@Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Chupacabra Hybrid]{Chupacabra Hybrid} (1): </strong>See page 95.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>SHOWDOWN</h3>\n<p>GlenMac's key sends the elevator slowly downward. At the bottom, the doors open upon a sparsely appointed waiting room guarded by a cluster of armed Sweet Heart mercenaries. GlenMac's presence allows the group to pass through unmolested; otherwise they attempt to detain the intruders&mdash; peacefully if possible but with lethal force if necessary&mdash;until they can clear things up with Helen.</p>\n<p>A single doorway at the other end of the room leads to the Sweet Heart bunker, a 5\"&times;7\" room that serves as the nerve center for Helen's master ritual. Extra-large televisions show security camera footage of the ritual in progress within the supercollider tunnels, while smaller screens show scenes from the stadium, elevator entrance (where the ash demon and chupacabra hybrid may still be fighting), and even the antechamber they just left. A door opposite the entrance opens to the ritual area in the supercollider tunnels (see illustration).</p>\n<p>Three of Helen's ritualists wait in the control room. If fighting broke out in the antechamber then they attack at will. Otherwise, they are hostile but hold their attack until attacked in turn.</p>\n<p>At a dramatically appropriate moment (preferably near the end of combat), Helen enters the room from the tunnel door. If fighting is in progress, she uses her Puppeteer ring to freeze participants. On the next round, she uses the dominated characters to shield herself from any characters who resist her talisman. Once order has been restored, Helen says \"I've been wondering when you would get here. We still have some time. Let's chat.\"</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Sweet Heart @Compendium[world.etu-bestiary.Mercenary]{Mercenary} (6):</strong> Use the Mercenary Extra in East Texas University.</li>\n<li><strong>@Compendium[world.etu-bestiary.Ritualist]{Ritualist} (3):</strong> Use the Ritualist Extra in East Texas University with one talisman for each: Lightning Pen (bolt), Dumb Phone (confusion), Kitchen Timer (slow).</li>\n<li><strong>@Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Helen Lane]{Helen Lane}:</strong> See page 92.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>PARLEY</h3>\n<p>If the heroes are willing to parley, Helen patiently answers the heroes' questions, filling in any gaps about the Protectors, the Convergence, Sweet Heart, Project Super Human, and the Burn. Helen freely admits that Sweet Heart has murdered&mdash;and worse&mdash;to achieve their aims, but insists that with the fate of the world in the balance the ends most certainly justify the means.</p>\n<p>At this point the conversation shifts to @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Social Conflict]{Social Conflict}. Helen's goal is to convince the heroes (and GlenMac if he is present) that her ritual is the only way to prevent a global apocalypse. Presumably the heroes' aim is to dissuade her from the sacrifice or coming up with another way of stopping the Convergence.</p>\n<p>GlenMac's support gives the heroes a +1 to their opposed @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.★ Persuasion]{Persuasion} roll. If a character shows Helen the locket recovered from Jack's revenant on @Compendium[etu-rules.etu-setting-rules.Lake Greystone]{Lake Greystone}, her emotional turmoil results in a &ndash;1 penalty to her @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.★ Persuasion]{Persuasion} roll. The social conflict likely ends with one of the following results:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Joining Helen and helping finish the work they have spent the last 4 years trying to stop.</li>\n<li>A stalemate. Proceed to @Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-degrees-of-horror.Convergence]{Convergence}.</li>\n<li>Convincing Helen to find a way to perform the ritual without the mass sacrifice or finding another method of stopping the Convergence altogether. Proceed to @Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-degrees-of-horror.Convergence]{Convergence}.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Once the decision has been reached, a voice rings out over an intercom speaker. \"Something is wrong! The Convergence is speeding up. Repeat, Convergence effects have already begun. Estimate one hour until full Convergence.\" A video feed overlooking the stadium confirms the panicked announcement. The air over the football field ripples like a heat mirage. The Convergence has begun.</p>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"modules/etu-adventures/icons/logo-etu.webp","_id":"6sgPrux6K3Tzhn8H"}

Noises from the physical world unexpectedly intrude upon the spirit world as muted, underwater sounds that twist the mundane into the menacing and abnormal.</p>\n<p>The spirit world itself is like a shadowy, underwater version of the living world. If a hero looks out over campus, she sees that the buildings and locations reflect the layers of intense emotions imprinted on them. Newer buildings seem semi-transparent while the ghosts of destroyed buildings endure. Some seem twisted and sad, others warm and inviting. The stadium itself, home to so many emotional athletic wins and losses, is a twisted funhouse of darkness and light.</p>\n</section>\n<h3>The Other Side</h3>\n<p>Despite Helen's warning, the portal's other side at first seems identical to our own world. The heroes have crossed over into the spirit world, a twisted shadow of the living world where the living appear only as flickering blurs when they are visible at all. The heroes are now living ghosts.</p>\n<p>Magic&mdash;whether from talismans, ritual effects, or even lingering curses&mdash;give off an internal glow. The brightest glows come from down the supercollider tunnel, caused by the talismans the heroes unwittingly recovered for Helen's ritual. In the spirit world, De La Garza's Cross takes its true form as a Mayan spear-tip and the blue lens an all-seeing eye. Taking the spirit world projections of the talismans does not cause their portal to fail.</p>\n<p>In the spirit world, all weapons are \"spirit weapons\" and thus the normal demonic resistance to \"normal weapons\" does not apply.</p>\n<p>The elevator is unresponsive, which means the gang must pass through the wall or door, find the service ladder, and climb the elevator shaft to the surface.</p>\n<p>The stadium concourse is eerily silent. Once inside the stadium itself, the heroes can see why.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Talisman: </strong>Mayan Demon-Slayer (Str+d6, Parry +1, Reach 1, 2-handed weapon). In the spirit world, De La Garza's cross manifests in its original spear form. Add +6 damage when used against demons. A Touch attack against Despoiled Spirits invokes an exorcism with a Spirit +2 roll.</li>\n<li><strong>Talisman: </strong>Blue Eye. The blue lens from the Lantern of the Deep manifests as a glass-encased blue eyeball. The all-seeingeye casts a warm glow within a Medium Burst Template, reducing the Toughness of demons and Despoiled Spirits within its light by &ndash;1.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>CONVERGENCE</h3>\n<p>Dominating much of the football field, a demonic titan stands locked in weary concentration with its four arms wrapped around the base of an obelisk. The giant's head rises above the top of the stadium, while the tip of the obelisk points several stories further into the starless sky. From its tip, dark energy crackles outward from the stone tower and ensnares brilliant lines of power crisscrossing overhead&mdash;the Pinebox ley lines. The conduits of supernatural power creep slowly nearer the obelisk's tip, only feet away from touching. Already, the air surrounding the titan shimmers and the heroes can catch glimmers of the living world through the forming portal.</p>\n<p>Heroes who succeed at a Notice roll take note that the titan appears to be having trouble keeping its head upright and its eyes open. In fact, its weary stance, quivering muscles, and gaunt appearance suggests that it has been locked in this ritual for a very long time. With a Knowledge (Occult) &ndash;2 roll, the hero realizes that the obelisk is draining the titan's life as fuel. The entire diorama is an elaborate ritual that has been building for a millennium and despite its impressive size the titan is neither the demon king nor the Convergence's mastermind. It's a nearly depleted battery.</p>\n<p>After the initial shock of seeing the titan, the heroes begin to take in other details. Nightmarish winged demons swoop through the sky overhead. Some circle the forming portal while others weave in and out of the stadium. Within their talons the winged horrors carry the ghosts of Pinebox and drop them at the feet of an arch-demon standing immediately below the titan.</p>\n<p>Although tiny at the feet of the titan, the Corrupting One is a terror in its own right. Tall and darkly beautiful like an obsidian knife, this demon radiates ancient power. The Corrupting One roughly grasps each spirit and uses its Corruption Special Ability to create fodder for its army. Despoiled spirits restlessly roam the football field and stadium seating, along with a number of imps, chaos demons, and other lesser demons awaiting their assault on the living world.</p>\n<h3>END GAME</h3>\n<p>The Dean should make frequent Notice rolls to determine when a winged horror spots the heroes. To the demons, the gang merely appears to be as-yet-uncorrupted spirits and thus don't initially earn the wrath of the entire stadium. When they are spotted, send one winged horror for every two characters. If the creatures are not dispatched within four rounds, make a Notice roll for more to join the fight.</p>\n<p>Some despoiled spirits should be familiar to the heroes&mdash;phantoms they have \"hunted\" or NPCs (both good and evil) who have died through misadventure. Now insane with torment, their attacks are vicious but uncoordinated, like those of a zombie. If not killed outright, these poor souls can be freed from the Corrupting One's enslavement with a successful use of holy water, the Mayan Demon Slayer (De La Garza's Cross), or an Exorcism. Freed spirits volunteer to join the heroes.</p>\n<p>The obelisk is the key to stopping the Convergence. Allow the heroes to get creative. Destroying it through a direct attack is unlikely, but applying even a small measure of holy water directly to its surface is enough to interrupt its evil magic. Alternately&mdash;and most likely&mdash;making the titan drop the obelisk causes it to break when it slams into the ground.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the titan only drops the obelisk upon its death. Its sheer size makes it easy to hit but hard to damage. Fortunately it ignores all attacks to focus on holding up the obelisk. The Corrupting One is not so accommodating. It and its minions attack with abandon. If the heroes become overrun too quickly, describe a counter-attack by the remainder of Pinebox's as-yet uncorrupted spirits to take some of the pressure off their immediate battle.</p>\n<h3>ESCAPE HOME</h3>\n<p>Once the Convergence Ritual is disrupted, surviving heroes are free to return to the Sweet Heart portal. In fact, the longer they linger the more likely they will be swarmed by enraged demons. Once the survivors decide to flee for safety, switch to the Chase rules found in the Savage Worlds rulebook.</p>\n<p>This is a standard @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Chases and Vehicles]{Chase}, the characters fleeing for their lives with two Wild Card demons and one lesser demon per hero in hot pursuit. The penultimate round occurs down the elevator shaft and the final round is a pell-mell chase through the Sweet Heart base back to the portal. Demons with an Advantage over a character on the last round can choose to enter the portal rather than attack. Such demons have to be fought on the other side.</p>\n<p>Characters who fail to overcome a Complication on the last round find that the portal briefly flickered out of existence at the moment they tried to cross through. If still alive, stranded characters can make one more attempt through the collapsing portal on an \"extra\" round or remain stuck in the spirit world forever.</p>\n<h3>EPILOGUE</h3>\n<p>Once home, the characters learn that the strain of holding open the portal drove Helen quietly insane. Her hair is stark white and her eyes eerily blank. Based on the few words the characters can understand from her mumbling, the witch seems to be reliving the 1950s before she murdered her friends. Although Sweet Heart is not destroyed, its leader is effectively gone.</p>\n<p>Once above ground, the heroes find that the graduation ceremony has concluded and their fellow students are streaming out of the stadium to go celebrate. Some might comment on a bizarre special effects light show in the middle of the football field, but otherwise no one seems the wiser about what was happening all around them.</p>\n<p>President Nelson approaches the heroes, hands them each a cardboard tube containing their diplomas, and congratulates them. They've graduated.</p>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"modules/etu-adventures/icons/logo-etu.webp","_id":"MVUTg0dLhPfjzVut"}

Most tried to ignore the threat and go on with their lives, but not all. Those with a special defiant spark found strength in unity against the darkness. When they applied as a university \"club\" to access campus resources, the Pinebox Protection Society was officially founded.</p>\n<section class=\"secret\">\n<p>\"The Protectors\" included Professor Daniels and students Jack Little, Crayton White, Helen LaCroix, Judith Fowler, and Nina Castle.</p>\n</section>\n<p>The amateur investigators threw themselves into the study of the supernatural and its weaknesses, including fighting magic with magic.</p>\n<h2>THE FIRST CONVERGENCE</h2>\n<p>Despite their best efforts, more supernatural oddities and occult crackpots threatened Pinebox than when they had started three years earlier. Months of research led the investigators to conclude that the Earth's network of ley lines&mdash;invisible lines of supernatural power&mdash;were bending out of position into an overlapping grid only a few miles from Pinebox. At every point the lines crossed, the nexus burned like a beacon to supernatural creatures and psychic humans alike. If unchecked, the shifting lines would eventually overlap in a single point of focused energy with the intensity to burn away the barrier between our world and the supernatural.</p>\n<p>Although the Convergence's cause remained a mystery, rumor of a fantastic powerful occult artifact offered hope. The Lantern of the Deep was reputed to be able to focus a ritualist's power to great effect and had last been seen in Golan County only a few generations earlier.</p>\n<p>With the coming Convergence causing more and more havoc in Pinebox, finding the Lantern of the Deep became Helen LaCroix's overriding obsession. This single-mindedness of purpose blinded her to the way in which her boyfriend Jack Little and Nina Castle became close&hellip;and more than friends.</p>\n<p>When the inevitable realization finally struck, Helen tried to put her mission first and pretend she didn't know her lover and friend had betrayed her. The young woman's resolve crumbled weeks later when she was paired with Nina on an undertaking to recover a talisman sought by cultists. In a moment of heartache and weakness, she let her repressed fury spill out in a white-hot supernatural fire that consumed her friend on the spot.</p>\n<p>Although Helen blamed the murder on the cultists, the Protectors' first loss cast a heavy shadow on the remaining members. Meanwhile, guilt poisoned and ground down Helen such that outwardly she appeared distraught like her friends. Inside, her sanity slowly dissolved.</p>\n<h2>THE FINAL RITUAL</h2>\n<p>With the Convergence only a day away, supernatural chaos in Pinebox rose to a fever pitch. Fortunately, not all who felt the silent call were crazy or evil. Soldiers and scientists from nearby Base X and a secret troop of Texas Rangers called the Texas 13 set up a last line of defense at ground zero.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the Protectors tried one last gamble and captured a demon that had been terrorizing campus. Once imprisoned within their sanctuary, the private room where they conducted their more elaborate rituals, they bargained with the demon for the location of the Lantern of the Deep. Expecting trickery, the heroes left the demon entrapped while they raced to the talisman.</p>\n<p>The investigators found the lantern on Dale Island in Lake Greystone, cleared a space on the beach, and began the most dangerous ritual they had ever attempted. By merging and channeling the collective power of each investigator through the blue lens of the lantern, they pushed apart the warping ley lines.</p>\n<p>At the ritual's crescendo, the wild magic linked the friends together in heart, mind, and soul. In that moment, Helen's guilt and madness were finally laid bare for all. The ritual faltered, then failed. In the stunned silence that followed, Helen lashed out in shame and anger, killing her stupefied friends before they could recover. The last to die was her former lover, who had retreated to their boat with the talisman.</p>\n<p>Jack was a dozen yards from the island's shore when his former girlfriend's wrath caught up to him. In his final moments, Jack focused his will through the blue lens of the Lantern of the Deep and made himself a revenant&mdash;an undead guardian of the lantern immune to Helen's magic&mdash;and sank beneath the lake's surface.</p>\n<h2>THE BURN</h2>\n<p>Just as dawn began touching the treetops, exhausted, crying, and only partially aware of her surroundings, Helen pushed through the last thicket of heavy brush into ground zero of the Convergence. A zone of death lay hundreds of yards in front of her. Although no heat radiated from the ground, all plant and animal life appeared heavily charred.</p>\n<p>At the Convergence's epicenter on the crest of a small hill, Helen found the remains of a bitter battle between inhuman creatures and the Base X and Texas 13 allies. As with the plant life, nothing survived the wave of death that had washed outward from her spell.</p>\n<p>Although it appeared that the ritual had stopped the invasion, Helen prepared a scrying ritual to be certain. While she was casting, two survivors climbed the small hill and joined her. The pair from Base X, Thomas Brownell and Dr. Jenson, had been just beyond the edge of the wave of destruction. Wild magic unlocked psychic ability in one and genius in the other&hellip;in exchange for a lifetime of nightmares. When the ritual completed, the trio saw the ley lines had indeed been pushed apart, but not to their natural courses. The Protectors had only delayed the Convergence, not stopped it. Each traumatized in their own way by the previous night, the survivors vowed to stopsuch a catastrophe from happening again, at any cost.</p>\n<h2>THERE IS ANOTHER</h2>\n<p>Unknown to the trio, one other witness to the Battle of the Burn survived the night. While the struggle raged all around, the Texas 13's youngest member was struck in the back by a stray bullet. Nelson Baer lay bleeding and in agony when the wave of death silenced the battle. Hours later when he dragged himself to an abandoned Jeep, he vowed that he would change his name and start a new life. Although he left the Burn behind, he could never leave the guilt.</p>\n</div>\n</div>","_id":"UomJFPAoqEqjVepC"}

Even after Jenson's death, Sweet Heart continues funding research and development into all manner of ways to create the ultimate soldier. Some of these same methods have led to new treatments for degenerative diseases&mdash;medical patents that earn the company billions.</p>\n<p>Within the company, only a dozen \"inner circle\" members know about the Convergence and Sweet Heart's true mission. These trusted members are recruited for their extraordinary talent, such as being a master of the occult, a powerful psychic, or a biotech genius. Others&mdash;including corporate leadership&mdash;are only given enough information to perform their roles. Helen is satisfied calling the shots from the shadows, her puppeteer Talisman putting a swift end to dissent.</p>\n<p>Sweet Heart's vast operational budget easily allows the inner circle to buy the loyalty, or at least the silence, of anyone who stumbles upon secrets best left forgotten. When evidence of \"weird stuff\" reaches the Pinebox Police Department, Golan County Sheriff's Department, or even campus administration, there are those within who earn a tidy fortune by making it disappear. When in doubt about what Sweet Heart can or can't do, just remember: they have psychics, magic, and billions of dollars.</p>\n</section>\n<h3>SUPER HUMAN</h3>\n<p>With allies, if not a plan, Helen found a new cornerstone with which to rebuild her sanity. The trio determined that the Convergence would not form again for decades, giving them time to find a solution. Unlike her old friends, the new trinity vowed that morality was a luxury. What was the value of individual human life when all humanity could be extinguished in a supernatural apocalypse?</p>\n<p>Yet even freed from most moral constraints, time marched forward without bringing them any closer to a solution. After a decade of failure, the allies recruited others to their cause. While Helen focused on improving her ritual to reverse the Convergence, the others focused on building an army to fight what might come through. They called it their Super Human project, which became the genesis for a wave of valuable biotech patents under the guise of the Sweet Heart Foundation. Although only core, trusted members were revealed the full truth, the Foundation and its for-profit subsidiaries grew into a powerful, wealthy asset.</p>\n<h3>HELEN LACROIX</h3>\n<p>Of the original trinity, only Helen remains. An unintended consequence of slaughtering her friends during the unification ritual was the infusion of their magical abilities and life force. Although 60 years have passed, the sole remaining Protector is relatively untouched by age. Although she still directs her inner circle within Sweet Heart, she prefers to operate from the shadows and has changed her identity several times. Few living people know her past, and none know her secret shame.</p>\n<p>Today she calls herself Helen Lane and poses as a Cultural Studies professor at ETU, where she can monitor the Convergence and Sweet Heart. Although no less ruthless on matters of the Convergence, the years have mellowed the sorceress in other ways. She casually dates a colleague by the name of Dr. Glen Maclanahan, whom she also recruited into her inner circle due to his extensive knowledge of folklore and local legend.</p>\n<p>Although the Protectors' botched ritual bought the world a sixty-year reprieve, the ley lines are once again converging. This time, the epicenter is forming over the ETU campus rather than an isolated forest. Nexus points are themselves converging and merging, causing ever greater paranormal activity.</p>\n<p>While the Super Human project has made some recent successes pairing a genetically enhanced chupacabra with a psychic handler as a potential weapon against a demonic invasion, Helen's own long range plan is also nearing fruition. Using secret tunnels far beneath The Raven's Nest football stadium, she and her cabal of ritualists hope to release a burst of magic that will restore the ley lines to their natural paths. Yet the Convergence creeps ever closer and she still needs certain talismans and rare components to ensure success.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, the first cloned chupacabra creature is being tested and has been used on occasion to eliminate security leaks. In fact, brief sightings have already generated a campus urban legend of a spiny humanoid they call \"the Needler.\"</p>\n<p>Finally, the university prepares for the traditional orientation session for incoming Freshmen. Circumventing her more tepid Sweet Heart collaborators, \"Helen Lane\" sees an opportunity to head off the apocalypse even without the missing ritual components. All it needs is a mass sacrifice&hellip;</p>\n</div>\n</div>","_id":"dU6wHv6SQFv6xGXD"}

When cornered, the scientist claims that he is trying to get it away from the Foundation because they plan on using it to create their own army. </em></p>\n<section class=\"ridged-block-float\">\n<h3>BACKGROUND</h3>\n<p>Dr. Allen Miller, an up-and-coming ETU researcher, accepted a multi-million dollar grant from the Sweet Heart Foundation to create a drug to imbue extra strength and speed without the usual doping side effects. Sweet Heart provided a research partner, one who had previously worked at MasterGene under Dr. Philip Perry. (See the published Pinebox adventure <em>The Beast Within</em>.) His benefactors also provided unique samples from earlier research to use as building blocks. The samples included a curious gray ash (from @Compendium[etu-rules.etu-setting-rules.The Burn]{The Burn}), the Fenris Virus, and lycanthrope blood samples. Although not told directly, he inferred that Sweet Heart plans on militarizing the drug.</p>\n<p>That was when Dr. Miller started his own secret research to sell to the highest bidder. While directing the official research down dead ends, Dr. Miller struck upon a formula that created an improved wolf-man&mdash;a human with the reflexes of a werewolf but human reasoning and self-control. All that had remained was the superficial issue of curbing the full-body hair growth.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, his Sweet Heart Foundation research partner, @Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Aubrey Wright]{Aubrey Wright}, became suspicious and confronted him. Using a limited supply of his most recent formulation (S.H. 243) upon himself, he attacked her, stole the research data, and staged an escape. However, rather than fleeing across campus as a wolf-man he returned to his hidden lab until the drug wore off.</p>\n<p>&hellip;Meanwhile, although GlenMac proved his loyalty to Helen, the gang's success on Lake Greystone only confirmed her suspicion that his new prot&eacute;g&eacute;s deserved closer scrutiny. GlenMac stubbornly shielded them from Jackson's fate but acquiesced to a new test setting them upon recovering Sweet Heart's stolen research.</p>\n</section>\n<h3>BRUNCH</h3>\n<p>The heroes receive a hasty call from Professor @Compendium[etu-rules.etu-bestiary.Glenmac]{GlenMac} to discuss an important new investigation. The meeting is set for brunch at the Faculty Club, a fancy restaurant on campus reserved for faculty members and their guests. At the restaurant @Compendium[etu-rules.etu-bestiary.Glenmac]{GlenMac} is joined by another Sweet Heart agent, whom he introduces as biology professor Dr. Wayne LeGrevellec. Professor @Compendium[etu-rules.etu-bestiary.Glenmac]{GlenMac}&nbsp;explains that last night he was alerted to a strange security camera video by a security office student worker who knows he is interested in weird stuff.</p>\n<p>Dr. LeGrevellec plays the footage on his phone. A woman in a lab coat is attacked by a creature that somewhat resembles the Needler or a werewolf. The struggle ends with the woman's head slamming into a counter top. The other figure quickly collects a few vials from a tray and rips out an external hard drive before fleeing the camera's field of vision.</p>\n<p>Dr. LeGrevellec says that he thinks the attacker in the lab next door to his was its own researcher, Dr. Allen Miller. The woman, his research partner, survived the attack but is under observation due to a concussion. The attack occurred last night and campus security contacted him after the attack for help identifying the subject in the video. He says he doesn't know what his colleague was researching, but a private foundation has been funding several professors' cuttingedge research into gene therapy using the healing properties from other animals. Presumably Dr. Miller became infected with his own experimental gene therapy and may be undergoing radical mental changes as well as the obvious physical one. Campus security believes the attacker is someone in a gorilla suit, but GlenMac agrees that it's no suit.</p>\n<p>Dr. LeGrevellec hands them a slip of paper with the addresses for Dr. Miller's lab and home, and his lab assistant's name (@Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Aubrey Wright]{Aubrey Wright}). He explains that Dr. Miller is still unaccounted for. No other security cameras caught a man in a gorilla suit leaving the building. He says that as university staff he and GlenMac are too conspicuous to openly investigate, but students are largely overlooked. He asks that they find Dr. Miller before he hurts anyone else and retrieve the hard drive and vials in the hope that they can be used to find a cure.

When cornered, the scientist claims that he is trying to get it away from the Foundation because they plan on using it to create their own army. </em></p>\n<section class=\"ridged-block-float\">\n<h3>BACKGROUND</h3>\n<p>Dr. Allen Miller, an up-and-coming ETU researcher, accepted a multi-million dollar grant from the Sweet Heart Foundation to create a drug to imbue extra strength and speed without the usual doping side effects. Sweet Heart provided a research partner, one who had previously worked at MasterGene under Dr. Philip Perry. (See the published Pinebox adventure <em>The Beast Within</em>.) His benefactors also provided unique samples from earlier research to use as building blocks. The samples included a curious gray ash (from @Compendium[etu-rules.etu-setting-rules.The Burn]{The Burn}), the Fenris Virus, and lycanthrope blood samples. Although not told directly, he inferred that Sweet Heart plans on militarizing the drug.</p>\n<p>That was when Dr. Miller started his own secret research to sell to the highest bidder. While directing the official research down dead ends, Dr. Miller struck upon a formula that created an improved wolf-man&mdash;a human with the reflexes of a werewolf but human reasoning and self-control. All that had remained was the superficial issue of curbing the full-body hair growth.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, his Sweet Heart Foundation research partner, @Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Aubrey Wright]{Aubrey Wright}, became suspicious and confronted him. Using a limited supply of his most recent formulation (S.H. 243) upon himself, he attacked her, stole the research data, and staged an escape. However, rather than fleeing across campus as a wolf-man he returned to his hidden lab until the drug wore off.</p>\n<p>&hellip;Meanwhile, although GlenMac proved his loyalty to Helen, the gang's success on Lake Greystone only confirmed her suspicion that his new prot&eacute;g&eacute;s deserved closer scrutiny. GlenMac stubbornly shielded them from Jackson's fate but acquiesced to a new test setting them upon recovering Sweet Heart's stolen research.</p>\n</section>\n<h3>BRUNCH</h3>\n<p>The heroes receive a hasty call from Professor @Compendium[etu-rules.etu-bestiary.Glenmac]{GlenMac} to discuss an important new investigation. The meeting is set for brunch at the Faculty Club, a fancy restaurant on campus reserved for faculty members and their guests. At the restaurant @Compendium[etu-rules.etu-bestiary.Glenmac]{GlenMac} is joined by another Sweet Heart agent, whom he introduces as biology professor Dr. Wayne LeGrevellec. Professor @Compendium[etu-rules.etu-bestiary.Glenmac]{GlenMac}&nbsp;explains that last night he was alerted to a strange security camera video by a security office student worker who knows he is interested in weird stuff.</p>\n<p>Dr. LeGrevellec plays the footage on his phone. A woman in a lab coat is attacked by a creature that somewhat resembles the Needler or a werewolf. The struggle ends with the woman's head slamming into a counter top. The other figure quickly collects a few vials from a tray and rips out an external hard drive before fleeing the camera's field of vision.</p>\n<p>Dr. LeGrevellec says that he thinks the attacker in the lab next door to his was its own researcher, Dr. Allen Miller. The woman, his research partner, survived the attack but is under observation due to a concussion. The attack occurred last night and campus security contacted him after the attack for help identifying the subject in the video. He says he doesn't know what his colleague was researching, but a private foundation has been funding several professors' cuttingedge research into gene therapy using the healing properties from other animals. Presumably Dr. Miller became infected with his own experimental gene therapy and may be undergoing radical mental changes as well as the obvious physical one. Campus security believes the attacker is someone in a gorilla suit, but GlenMac agrees that it's no suit.</p>\n<p>Dr. LeGrevellec hands them a slip of paper with the addresses for Dr. Miller's lab and home, and his lab assistant's name (@Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Aubrey Wright]{Aubrey Wright}). He explains that Dr. Miller is still unaccounted for. No other security cameras caught a man in a gorilla suit leaving the building. He says that as university staff he and GlenMac are too conspicuous to openly investigate, but students are largely overlooked. He asks that they find Dr. Miller before he hurts anyone else and retrieve the hard drive and vials in the hope that they can be used to find a cure. He theorizes that an abrupt transformation like Dr. Miller's would quickly wear him out and that he is probably sleeping off the effects. If the heroes track him down before nightfall they have a good chance of subduing him without serious conflict.</p>\n<p>Throughout the briefing, @Compendium[etu-rules.etu-bestiary.Glenmac]{GlenMac}&nbsp;lets the other Sweet Heart agent spin his tale. He dislikes further dragging his prot&eacute;g&eacute;s into Sweet Heart business, but if directly questioned he begrudgingly agrees that there's a passing similarity to the Needler and that the research could be related.</p>\n<h3>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</h3>\n<p>Students who want to question the injured research partner, @Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Aubrey Wright]{Aubrey Wright}, can find her at different locations depending on the time of day.

The now-ethereal heroes must climb to the surface and find a way to disrupt the final moments of the Convergence. Then it's just the small matter of escaping with their lives. </em></p>\n<h3>THERE MIGHT BE ANOTHER WAY&hellip;</h3>\n<p>If the heroes have survived this far, then only one choice remains. How to stop the Convergence? If Helen convinced them to follow her plan, then allow them to carry it out and the terrible consequences to follow. Otherwise, if they reached a stalemate or convinced Helen that the price was too high, then she has an epiphany and blurts out \"Wait! There might be another way!\"</p>\n<p>Helen explains that with the Convergence having already weakened the barriers between worlds, they might be able to tear a smaller hole of their own and send a group through to find and stop whatever is causing the Convergence from the other side. She warns that if they are successful, they may very well find themselves trapped. She and the other ritualists will stay behind to hold open the gate and guard its use by any of the creatures from beyond. She offers some quick healing for anyone who needs it (one Wound each), weapons, and possibly the help of an Extra if needed.</p>\n<p>At the conclusion of Helen's ritual, a portal appears. Helen warns them to mentally prepare themselves for a totally alien, hellish landscape.</p>\n<section class=\"ridged-block-float\">\n<h3>We're in the Spirit World!</h3>\n<p>What's the spirit world like? I'm glad you asked! First, everything the characters carry through the portal with them manifests in the spirit world. All their firearms, melee weapons, and so on work normally, including using up ammunition. Further, in the spirit world, ghosts and demons are not Ethereal and can be damaged normally.</p>\n<p>By instinct the characters treat solid objects as solid, but with a Spirit roll they can pass through doors, walls, and the like. They cannot fly, nor can they activate electronic or mechanical devices in the \"real\" world. Noises from the physical world unexpectedly intrude upon the spirit world as muted, underwater sounds that twist the mundane into the menacing and abnormal.</p>\n<p>The spirit world itself is like a shadowy, underwater version of the living world. If a hero looks out over campus, she sees that the buildings and locations reflect the layers of intense emotions imprinted on them. Newer buildings seem semi-transparent while the ghosts of destroyed buildings endure. Some seem twisted and sad, others warm and inviting. The stadium itself, home to so many emotional athletic wins and losses, is a twisted funhouse of darkness and light.</p>\n</section>\n<h3>The Other Side</h3>\n<p>Despite Helen's warning, the portal's other side at first seems identical to our own world. The heroes have crossed over into the spirit world, a twisted shadow of the living world where the living appear only as flickering blurs when they are visible at all. The heroes are now living ghosts.</p>\n<p>Magic&mdash;whether from talismans, ritual effects, or even lingering curses&mdash;give off an internal glow. The brightest glows come from down the supercollider tunnel, caused by the talismans the heroes unwittingly recovered for Helen's ritual. In the spirit world, De La Garza's Cross takes its true form as a Mayan spear-tip and the blue lens an all-seeing eye. Taking the spirit world projections of the talismans does not cause their portal to fail.</p>\n<p>In the spirit world, all weapons are \"spirit weapons\" and thus the normal demonic resistance to \"normal weapons\" does not apply.</p>\n<p>The elevator is unresponsive, which means the gang must pass through the wall or door, find the service ladder, and climb the elevator shaft to the surface.</p>\n<p>The stadium concourse is eerily silent. Once inside the stadium itself, the heroes can see why.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Talisman: </strong>Mayan Demon-Slayer (Str+d6, Parry +1, Reach 1, 2-handed weapon). In the spirit world, De La Garza's cross manifests in its original spear form. Add +6 damage when used against demons. A Touch attack against Despoiled Spirits invokes an exorcism with a Spirit +2 roll.</li>\n<li><strong>Talisman: </strong>Blue Eye. The blue lens from the Lantern of the Deep manifests as a glass-encased blue eyeball. The all-seeingeye casts a warm glow within a Medium Burst Template, reducing the Toughness of demons and Despoiled Spirits within its light by &ndash;1.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>CONVERGENCE</h3>\n<p>Dominating much of the football field, a demonic titan stands locked in weary concentration with its four arms wrapped around the base of an obelisk. The giant's head rises above the top of the stadium, while the tip of the obelisk points several stories further into the starless sky. From its tip, dark energy crackles outward from the stone tower and ensnares brilliant lines of power crisscrossing overhead&mdash;the Pinebox ley lines. The conduits of supernatural power creep slowly nearer the obelisk's tip, only feet away from touching. Already, the air surrounding the titan shimmers and the heroes can catch glimmers of the living world through the forming portal.</p>\n<p>Heroes who succeed at a Notice roll take note that the titan appears to be having trouble keeping its head upright and its eyes open. In fact, its weary stance, quivering muscles, and gaunt appearance suggests that it has been locked in this ritual for a very long time. With a Knowledge (Occult) &ndash;2 roll, the hero realizes that the obelisk is draining the titan's life as fuel. The entire diorama is an elaborate ritual that has been building for a millennium and despite its impressive size the titan is neither the demon king nor the Convergence's mastermind. It's a nearly depleted battery.</p>\n<p>After the initial shock of seeing the titan, the heroes begin to take in other details. Nightmarish winged demons swoop through the sky overhead. Some circle the forming portal while others weave in and out of the stadium. Within their talons the winged horrors carry the ghosts of Pinebox and drop them at the feet of an arch-demon standing immediately below the titan.</p>\n<p>Although tiny at the feet of the titan, the Corrupting One is a terror in its own right. Tall and darkly beautiful like an obsidian knife, this demon radiates ancient power. The Corrupting One roughly grasps each spirit and uses its Corruption Special Ability to create fodder for its army. Despoiled spirits restlessly roam the football field and stadium seating, along with a number of imps, chaos demons, and other lesser demons awaiting their assault on the living world.</p>\n<h3>END GAME</h3>\n<p>The Dean should make frequent Notice rolls to determine when a winged horror spots the heroes. To the demons, the gang merely appears to be as-yet-uncorrupted spirits and thus don't initially earn the wrath of the entire stadium. When they are spotted, send one winged horror for every two characters. If the creatures are not dispatched within four rounds, make a Notice roll for more to join the fight.</p>\n<p>Some despoiled spirits should be familiar to the heroes&mdash;phantoms they have \"hunted\" or NPCs (both good and evil) who have died through misadventure. Now insane with torment, their attacks are vicious but uncoordinated, like those of a zombie. If not killed outright, these poor souls can be freed from the Corrupting One's enslavement with a successful use of holy water, the Mayan Demon Slayer (De La Garza's Cross), or an Exorcism. Freed spirits volunteer to join the heroes.</p>\n<p>The obelisk is the key to stopping the Convergence. Allow the heroes to get creative. Destroying it through a direct attack is unlikely, but applying even a small measure of holy water directly to its surface is enough to interrupt its evil magic. Alternately&mdash;and most likely&mdash;making the titan drop the obelisk causes it to break when it slams into the ground.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the titan only drops the obelisk upon its death. Its sheer size makes it easy to hit but hard to damage. Fortunately it ignores all attacks to focus on holding up the obelisk. The Corrupting One is not so accommodating. It and its minions attack with abandon. If the heroes become overrun too quickly, describe a counter-attack by the remainder of Pinebox's as-yet uncorrupted spirits to take some of the pressure off their immediate battle.</p>\n<h3>ESCAPE HOME</h3>\n<p>Once the Convergence Ritual is disrupted, surviving heroes are free to return to the Sweet Heart portal. In fact, the longer they linger the more likely they will be swarmed by enraged demons. Once the survivors decide to flee for safety, switch to the Chase rules found in the Savage Worlds rulebook.</p>\n<p>This is a standard @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Chases and Vehicles]{Chase}, the characters fleeing for their lives with two Wild Card demons and one lesser demon per hero in hot pursuit. The penultimate round occurs down the elevator shaft and the final round is a pell-mell chase through the Sweet Heart base back to the portal. Demons with an Advantage over a character on the last round can choose to enter the portal rather than attack. Such demons have to be fought on the other side.</p>\n<p>Characters who fail to overcome a Complication on the last round find that the portal briefly flickered out of existence at the moment they tried to cross through. If still alive, stranded characters can make one more attempt through the collapsing portal on an \"extra\" round or remain stuck in the spirit world forever.</p>\n<h3>EPILOGUE</h3>\n<p>Once home, the characters learn that the strain of holding open the portal drove Helen quietly insane. Her hair is stark white and her eyes eerily blank. Based on the few words the characters can understand from her mumbling, the witch seems to be reliving the 1950s before she murdered her friends. Although Sweet Heart is not destroyed, its leader is effectively gone.</p>\n<p>Once above ground, the heroes find that the graduation ceremony has concluded and their fellow students are streaming out of the stadium to go celebrate. Some might comment on a bizarre special effects light show in the middle of the football field, but otherwise no one seems the wiser about what was happening all around them.</p>\n<p>President Nelson approaches the heroes, hands them each a cardboard tube containing their diplomas, and congratulates them. They've graduated.</p>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"modules/etu-adventures/icons/logo-etu.webp","_id":"2yJUO8NZCMLtRNsF"}

Unfortunately, they must first fight their way through the reawakened demon army destroyed at the Burn. In the underground bunker, Helen makes her case for mass murder and gives the heroes a chance to join them. </em></p>\n<section class=\"ridged-block-float\">\n<h3>BACKGROUND</h3>\n<p>With the Super Human army crippled, Sweet Heart resorts to fighting the Convergence with magic. The ritual utilizes De La Garza's Cross, the dimensional visualizer, and the blue lens from the Lantern of the Deep to magnify Helen's original ritual that created the Burn. This time, she purposefully intends on sacrificing the thousands of students and families attending ETU's graduation ceremonies to fuel her spell and end the Convergence for good.</p>\n<p>The ritual is planned directly beneath the ETU graduation ceremonies in the \"abandoned\" supercollider tunnels beneath the football stadium. The sacrificial ritual begins at sunrise the morning of graduation, building throughout the day and climaxing near the end of graduation ceremonies.</p>\n</section>\n<h3>MAPPING</h3>\n<p>At the end of the previous adventure, Jackson asked the heroes to map the ley lines and predict where Helen and Sweet Heart will make them converge. Mapping three separate ley lines should be sufficient to reveal that the lines converge near the @Compendium[etu-rules.etu-setting-rules.The Raven's Nest]{The Raven's Nest} football stadium. @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Research]{Research} into the stadium (with prompting by Jackson, if necessary) reveals its genesis over the unfinished constructions of a supercollider project. For more on the supercollider project, see \"@Compendium[etu-rules.etu-setting-rules.The Raven's Nest]{The Raven's Nest}\" entry under ETU Places of Note in @Compendium[etu-rules.etu-setting-rules.East Texas University]{East Texas University}.</p>\n<h3>GRADUATION DAY</h3>\n<p>For those who passed their final exams, it's graduation day. The heroes' families are in town for the big evening ceremony, adding an extra flavor of chaos to festivities. Jackson contacts the heroes mid-morning and admits that he has been unable to find anything new about Sweet Heart's plans for the Convergence. It's time to confront @Compendium[etu-rules.etu-bestiary.Glenmac]{GlenMac} directly. To this end, he asks that they join him and plead with his old mentor. This encounter should be timed such that they do not find GlenMac until late afternoon, providing extra urgency for the events that follow.</p>\n<p>When the heroes confront him, @Compendium[etu-rules.etu-bestiary.Glenmac]{GlenMac} reacts first with anger and denial. He genuinely believes that the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few. Even so, with @Compendium[etu-rules.etu-setting-rules.Pinebox]{Pinebox's} sacrifice at hand he has found his resolution wavering. Unless the heroes skip straight to violence, this encounter becomes a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Social Conflict]{Social Conflict}. Given the chance, @Compendium[etu-rules.etu-bestiary.Glenmac]{GlenMac} tries to justify his duplicity and explains Sweet Heart's true purpose&mdash; not to usher in the Convergence but to stop it (+2 @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.★ Persuasion]{Persuasion} that round). He explains how Helen designed the supercollider to focus the magic of De La Garza's Cross through the blue lens of the Lantern of the Deep and into Lilly Boatwright's dimensional visualizer. However, even with the artifacts, only a mass human sacrifice can generate sufficient magical energy to restore the converging ley lines to their natural positions. Helen's new Burn&mdash;centered right on the ETU campus&mdash; will provide the energy necessary for preventing a far greater apocalypse.</p>\n<p>This confrontation has the potential to be a defining moment for the heroes, so roleplay it to the fullest. If the students can redeem GlenMac then not only do they win the battle with their virtues intact, but his renewed alliance gives them a better chance at stopping Helen's ritual and finding another way to stop the Convergence. GlenMac insists on accompanying the heroes, needing to make up for his part in Sweet Heart's schemes.</p>\n<p>If instead the heroes cast aside any pretense at virtue and force the information from him, then they learn only the essentials of how to find and use the secret elevator. In this case, they do not benefit from GlenMac's further help.</p>\n<p>In either case, when persuaded GlenMac hands over a control key to the elevator serving the enclosed alumni boxes overlooking the stadium. The same elevator also extends down all the way to a bunker adjacent to the supercollider tunnel.</p>\n<h3>THE BURN IS ALIVE</h3>\n<p>GlenMac receives a call on his cell phone while in the heroes' presence. Another of Helen's occultists tells him that the Burn has come alive. With the Convergence imminent, the lingering demonic spirits created new material vessels from the Burn's ashes and are marching toward Pinebox. Helen fears that the demons might derail Sweet Heart's ritual by slaughtering the intended victims before they can be properly sacrificed. Most of the primary site's security detail and ritualists are being diverted to fight a delaying action against the ash demons. GlenMac is to immediately return and help Helen with the sacrificial ritual.</p>\n<p>Now that they know how to enter the Sweet Heart bunker, the heroes can begin the assault at any time. This would be the ideal time to summon allies and fully equip. By the time the heroes arrive at the stadium, their classmates and families have already begun filing in for graduation. At your discretion, the heroes encounter a few familiar faces along the way, possibly bringing closure to earlier encounters.</p>\n<p>The alumni boxes are unused during the graduation ceremonies, leaving this part of the stadium relatively empty. Shortly after the heroes enter a roped-off section of hallway by the elevator, an ash demon stomps around the corner from the opposite direction. This creature broke past Sweet Heart's defenses and seeks the growing magical energies it senses below ground. Ignoring the heroes, it rushes to the elevator where it is met by a suddenly-visible chupacabra hybrid. This creature was the successful experiment Sweet Heart had tried to mass produce at Base X. Now only this ultimate specimen remains, tasked with guarding the elevator entrance. The creatures grasp and claw at one another, sending up puffs of ash from the demon \"body.\" As long as they battle one another, the creatures largely ignore the heroes. This presents an opportunity to slip past to the elevator or to fight the victor after it has been worn down. GlenMac cannot command the chupacabra hybrid, but it obeys \"Paul\" if the lame creature is present.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>@Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Ash Demon]{Ash Demon} (1): </strong>Use &uuml;berdemon found in East Texas University with the addition of Weakness (Water): +d6 damage.</li>\n<li><strong>@Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Chupacabra Hybrid]{Chupacabra Hybrid} (1): </strong>See page 95.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>SHOWDOWN</h3>\n<p>GlenMac's key sends the elevator slowly downward. At the bottom, the doors open upon a sparsely appointed waiting room guarded by a cluster of armed Sweet Heart mercenaries. GlenMac's presence allows the group to pass through unmolested; otherwise they attempt to detain the intruders&mdash; peacefully if possible but with lethal force if necessary&mdash;until they can clear things up with Helen.</p>\n<p>A single doorway at the other end of the room leads to the Sweet Heart bunker, a 5\"&times;7\" room that serves as the nerve center for Helen's master ritual. Extra-large televisions show security camera footage of the ritual in progress within the supercollider tunnels, while smaller screens show scenes from the stadium, elevator entrance (where the ash demon and chupacabra hybrid may still be fighting), and even the antechamber they just left. A door opposite the entrance opens to the ritual area in the supercollider tunnels (see illustration).</p>\n<p>Three of Helen's ritualists wait in the control room. If fighting broke out in the antechamber then they attack at will. Otherwise, they are hostile but hold their attack until attacked in turn.</p>\n<p>At a dramatically appropriate moment (preferably near the end of combat), Helen enters the room from the tunnel door. If fighting is in progress, she uses her Puppeteer ring to freeze participants. On the next round, she uses the dominated characters to shield herself from any characters who resist her talisman. Once order has been restored, Helen says \"I've been wondering when you would get here. We still have some time. Let's chat.\"</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Sweet Heart @Compendium[world.etu-bestiary.Mercenary]{Mercenary} (6):</strong> Use the Mercenary Extra in East Texas University.</li>\n<li><strong>@Compendium[world.etu-bestiary.Ritualist]{Ritualist} (3):</strong> Use the Ritualist Extra in East Texas University with one talisman for each: Lightning Pen (bolt), Dumb Phone (confusion), Kitchen Timer (slow).</li>\n<li><strong>@Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Helen Lane]{Helen Lane}:</strong> See page 92.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>PARLEY</h3>\n<p>If the heroes are willing to parley, Helen patiently answers the heroes' questions, filling in any gaps about the Protectors, the Convergence, Sweet Heart, Project Super Human, and the Burn. Helen freely admits that Sweet Heart has murdered&mdash;and worse&mdash;to achieve their aims, but insists that with the fate of the world in the balance the ends most certainly justify the means.</p>\n<p>At this point the conversation shifts to @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Social Conflict]{Social Conflict}. Helen's goal is to convince the heroes (and GlenMac if he is present) that her ritual is the only way to prevent a global apocalypse. Presumably the heroes' aim is to dissuade her from the sacrifice or coming up with another way of stopping the Convergence.</p>\n<p>GlenMac's support gives the heroes a +1 to their opposed @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.★ Persuasion]{Persuasion} roll. If a character shows Helen the locket recovered from Jack's revenant on @Compendium[etu-rules.etu-setting-rules.Lake Greystone]{Lake Greystone}, her emotional turmoil results in a &ndash;1 penalty to her @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.★ Persuasion]{Persuasion} roll. The social conflict likely ends with one of the following results:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Joining Helen and helping finish the work they have spent the last 4 years trying to stop.</li>\n<li>A stalemate. Proceed to @Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-degrees-of-horror.Convergence]{Convergence}.</li>\n<li>Convincing Helen to find a way to perform the ritual without the mass sacrifice or finding another method of stopping the Convergence altogether. Proceed to @Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-degrees-of-horror.Convergence]{Convergence}.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Once the decision has been reached, a voice rings out over an intercom speaker. \"Something is wrong! The Convergence is speeding up. Repeat, Convergence effects have already begun. Estimate one hour until full Convergence.\" A video feed overlooking the stadium confirms the panicked announcement. The air over the football field ripples like a heat mirage. The Convergence has begun.</p>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"modules/etu-adventures/icons/logo-etu.webp","_id":"dJDnNx6F3KtDSz0a"}

Jackson's plan involves a simultaneous sabotage of two vulnerable points, assuring success even if one group fails. While on site, the characters learn the date of the Convergence&mdash;three days after graduation. </em></p>\n<section class=\"ridged-block-float\">\n<h3>BACKGROUND</h3>\n<p>Immediately after escaping the Needler attack in his house, a scared and injured Jackson Green went into hiding and has been quietly probing into Helen's background, her connection to the chupacabra, and the extent of his old mentor GlenMac's involvement.</p>\n<p>Over time, he ferreted out Helen's connection to the Sweet Heart Foundation, some of the company's schemes, and the existence of a second Convergence. He surmises that Helen and her cohorts are ushering in this new Convergence in a bid at world conquest. The chupacabra creatures and the various incarnations of the Super Human project&mdash; aka \"Sweet Heart\"&mdash;all seem to lead to a goal of creating an unstoppable army.</p>\n<p>That belief was firmly reinforced when he discovered that Sweet Heart had brokered a federal grant to research \"human combatant enhancement\" and was awarded the use of the old Base X military outpost for private research. Jackson has spent nearly a year camped in the Big Thicket spying upon the base. He even rescued a project Super Human reject&mdash;a chupacabra hybrid runt that survived a botched execution. Since being nursed back to health, the intelligent but mute \"Paul\" has served as Jackson's near-invisible eyes and ears both on campus and off. Now, Sweet Heart appears to be near success and Jackson is ready to make his move. Only, he needs a little help&hellip;</p>\n</section>\n<h3>THE BIG REVEAL</h3>\n<p>Early one evening, each student gets a text message from an unrecognized number. <em>\"2nite ur ?s will b answered. Meet @ nature trl west side of campus. 10 pm. Don't B seen.\"</em> A few moments later, a second message follows. <em>\"Bring Pizza Barn lrg supreme.\"</em></p>\n<p>As promised, at 10 pm the silhouette of a stranger appears in the shadows beyond the well-lit head of the nature trail leading into the Big Thicket. The stranger is \"@Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Paul]{Paul},\" dressed in a t-shirt and baggy pair of sweat pants with a cap pulled low to further hide its face in shadow. The shadow beckons them to follow, and he leads them swiftly and silently down the trail. Eventually they arrive at a clear-cut right-of-way used for power transmission lines. Their guide is nowhere to be seen, but a battered jeep sits idling, its headlights turned off. A very lean and bedraggled @Compendium[etu-rules.etu-bestiary.Jackson Green]{Jackson Green} sits at the wheel.</p>\n<p>Their old friend wears ripped camouflage clothing, worn boots, and doesn't appear to have shaved in several months. Even his trademark cowboy hat is crumpled. By way of greeting, he asks if the heroes brought the pizza and tears into whatever food they offer.</p>\n<p>On the reckless drive back to his base camp over logging trails and cleared fence lines, Jackson explains the events leading up to his disappearance, the revelation about GlenMac's betrayal, what he knows about the first Convergence from President Nelson, and the investigation into Sweet Heart. While he refers to \"an ally on campus,\" he refuses to share President Nelson's name, saying \"It's not my secret to tell.\"</p>\n<h3>THE JOB</h3>\n<p>Having arrived at a primitive campsite with at least some of their questions answered, Jackson now asks for their help. His spying on Base X revealed a systematic program for creating larger and stronger chupacabras. With that explanation, Jackson introduces \"Paul,\" who drops his camouflage and appears at the edge of camp. Together they learned that thousands of incubation vats have been installed on @Compendium[etu-rules.etu-setting-rules.Base 10 Military Base]{Base X} and that Sweet Heart has already begun incubating an army of larger, stronger chupacabra hybrids.</p>\n<p>Jackson believes that the base&mdash;and Sweet Heart&mdash;is politically protected. Two separate attempts to publicly expose Sweet Heart were almost instantly and thoroughly squashed. He's not suicidal; he knows that a direct fight is a losing proposition. However, sabotage is a different matter. He and Paul identified ways to disrupt the incubation system before the army can be fully grown. Although it sounds dangerous, the facility is only staffed with a skeleton crew. Because he'll only get one chance, Jackson's plan is for two groups to hit both weak points simultaneously, doubling the odds for success. One group will introduce a poison into the incubator water system while the other group tampers with the temperature regulator. Jackson lets his friends pick which target they want to attack and how the groups will be split. He even provides printed diagrams of a standard Titan 1 missile base layout (easily found online) to use for planning.</p>\n<p>Although their old friend is open to suggestions on the particulars of the mission, he is adamant about attacking the very next evening. He resists allowing anyone to leave his campsite for fear of Sweet Heart being alerted, but he agrees to send Paul back into @Compendium[etu-rules.etu-setting-rules.Pinebox]{Pinebox} before sunrise if the gang needs certain supplies or a specific item.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>@Compendium[etu-rules.etu-bestiary.Jackson Green]{Jackson Green}:</strong> see Jackson Green in East Texas University</li>\n<li><strong>@Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Paul]{Paul}:</strong> Use the Chupacabra Hybrid on page 95, with the addition of being a Wild Card with the Lame Hindrance and Size -1.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>STEALTH TIME</h3>\n<p>Infiltrators must overcome the recently restored outer fence, skirt an obstacle course Jackson calls the chupacabra proving grounds, and dodge security cameras. Once near the silos, they must sneak into the tunnel network. The main entrance is a concrete stairwell adjacent to the above-ground barracks. A security camera points directly at the door, so their first task is disabling or tricking it. Opening the door requires @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Thievery]{Thievery} &ndash;2. The air handling system offers an alternative route large enough to accommodate a person but is full of spinning propellers. The emergency exits mentioned later in Plan B are reinforced and may only be opened from the inside.</p>\n<h3>SOMEBODY'S POISONED THE WATERHOLE</h3>\n<p>Jackson provides a canister of poison to the team sabotaging the incubator water supply. The incubators require a constant flow of water, which is enhanced with project Super Human drugs and sprayed as a fine mist to be absorbed by the chupacabra eggs.</p>\n<p>The poison team must sneak into the underground Power House, which controls both power generation and water filtration. The characters encounter a technician inside the noisy Power House performing maintenance. Since only a handful of Sweet Heart insiders are privy to the&nbsp;&nbsp;@Compendium[etu-rules.etu-setting-rules.Base 10 Military Base]{Base X} operation and they all know one another, it requires a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.★ Persuasion]{Persuasion} &ndash;2 roll to bluff past the technician.</p>\n<p>Once past the technician, the heroes must identify the filtration system (@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Science]{Science}, @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Repair]{Repair}, or similar) remove one of the replaceable filters, pour in poison, then return the system to service. The poison takes roughly thirty minutes to kill the growing chupacabras. Unfortunately, just as they complete their task (if not before), an alarm sounds throughout the underground base. Proceed to Plan B on page 43.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Sweet Heart @Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Technican]{Technican} (1):</strong> Use Cultist Extra in East Texas University, replacing dagger with a large wrench (Str+d6).</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>IS IT HOT IN HERE, OR IS IT ME?</h3>\n<p>The incubating chupacabras require a moist, hot environment such as the one in the greenhouse when the students killed their first creature. The group who targets the temperature control system must find an unattended computer or use their own portable computer to access a wired outlet and change the temperature settings. With a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.★ Notice]{Notice} roll, the team can locate a network jack in a silo (see Plan B for silo descriptions), where they also encounter a Sweet Heart technician. Using their own computer to access the network requires a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Hacking]{Hacking} roll &ndash;2 or @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Research]{Research} &ndash;4.</p>\n<p>The Sweet Heart computer with the most direct access is found in the most dangerous location&mdash;the former missile base Control Center. The Control Center is a two story bunker with updated living and working quarters. The work area on the upper level includes network servers, a large TV displaying feeds from half a dozen security cameras placed in the silos, and a laboratory. Six off-duty Sweet Heart technicians lounge in the lower level living quarters. The students must fight or bluff their way past a working technician without alerting the rest of the base in order to access the server.</p>\n<p>No matter how the heroes access the network, once logged in the hacker is presented with a directory of available options. One is a directory tree labeled \"project Super Human\" files, with subdirectories detailing the chimera experiments, the Fenris virus, Dr. Perry's genetic experiments, and many more.</p>\n<p>Multiple fail-safes prevent the incubators from being shut down, but the characters can change the temperature setting. Although it takes a while for them to completely die, the developmental damage caused in the first hour makes the chupacabras useless for Sweet Heart's purposes.</p>\n<p>As heroes are finishing up, an alert pops up on the screen reading \"Convergence simulation 9,361 complete. Play now? Yes / No\" Choosing \"Yes\" plays an animation of ley lines over @Compendium[etu-rules.etu-setting-rules.Golan County]{Golan County} warping and converging over @Compendium[etu-rules.etu-setting-rules.Pinebox]{Pinebox}. The map detail isn't precise enough to show an exact epicenter but it appears to be somewhere over campus. The running date in the bottom corner ends in May three days after graduation.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Sweet Heart @Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Technican]{Technican} (1):</strong> Use Cultist Extra from East Texas University, replacing the pistol with a Stun Gun used to keep unruly chupacabras in line.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>PLAN B</h3>\n<p>As the heroes complete their assignment, if not a little before, a general alarm sounds throughout the complex. A Sweet Heart psychic has sensed trouble and alerted the crew to seal the entrance, trapping the students underground. At the sound of the alarm, the technicians arm themselves from a weapons locker in the living quarters. They then move in teams to secure the Power House and Control Center, dogging the heavy-duty doors behind them. Meanwhile, in one of the former propellant terminals adjacent to a silo, the pack of improved chupacabras (one for each character) stir from slumber in their lair and go on the hunt. Considering the missile base's shape, they most likely encounter their prey in the long tunnel between the entrance and one of the silos. They fight to the death.</p>\n<p>According to Jackson's map, the only other way out is via an old crew emergency exit adjacent to each silo. These doors are old and firmly sealed from the inside, but usable.</p>\n<p>The most direct route to an emergency exit takes the students directly through a silo, where they get a first-hand look at the nascent Sweet Heart army. Rack-mounted incubators completely line the silo walls, stretching into the darkness above and below. A ramp in the silo's center spirals in both directions, providing access to each three foot tall device. Glass windows within the incubators show a fine mist falling over a bristled, football-sized egg.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Sweet Heart @Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Technican]{Technican} (4):</strong> Use Cultist Extra in East Texas University, sans dagger.</li>\n<li><strong>@Compendium[etu-adventures.etu-adventures-bestiary.Improved Chupacabra Pack Leader]{Improved Chupacabra Pack Leader} (1):</strong> The creature's pack leader is especially tough.

He asks them to map out the ley lines and figure out where the Convergence is likely to take place and notify him through the same number he used to text them. Finally, he makes the heroes promise that they won't let on that they know GlenMac's secret. At the moment their old mentor is their best shot at learning more about Sweet Heart. The haggard former grad student parts ways with his friends, but not before warning them that the worst is yet to come. Helen and the rest of Sweet Heart will be ruthless to complete their conquest.</p>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"modules/etu-adventures/icons/logo-etu.webp","_id":"QeHkNUrQg04Qs7Zu"}

Most tried to ignore the threat and go on with their lives, but not all. Those with a special defiant spark found strength in unity against the darkness. When they applied as a university \"club\" to access campus resources, the Pinebox Protection Society was officially founded.</p>\n<section class=\"secret\">\n<p>\"The Protectors\" included Professor Daniels and students Jack Little, Crayton White, Helen LaCroix, Judith Fowler, and Nina Castle.</p>\n</section>\n<p>The amateur investigators threw themselves into the study of the supernatural and its weaknesses, including fighting magic with magic.</p>\n<h2>THE FIRST CONVERGENCE</h2>\n<p>Despite their best efforts, more supernatural oddities and occult crackpots threatened Pinebox than when they had started three years earlier. Months of research led the investigators to conclude that the Earth's network of ley lines&mdash;invisible lines of supernatural power&mdash;were bending out of position into an overlapping grid only a few miles from Pinebox. At every point the lines crossed, the nexus burned like a beacon to supernatural creatures and psychic humans alike. If unchecked, the shifting lines would eventually overlap in a single point of focused energy with the intensity to burn away the barrier between our world and the supernatural.</p>\n<p>Although the Convergence's cause remained a mystery, rumor of a fantastic powerful occult artifact offered hope. The Lantern of the Deep was reputed to be able to focus a ritualist's power to great effect and had last been seen in Golan County only a few generations earlier.</p>\n<p>With the coming Convergence causing more and more havoc in Pinebox, finding the Lantern of the Deep became Helen LaCroix's overriding obsession. This single-mindedness of purpose blinded her to the way in which her boyfriend Jack Little and Nina Castle became close&hellip;and more than friends.</p>\n<p>When the inevitable realization finally struck, Helen tried to put her mission first and pretend she didn't know her lover and friend had betrayed her. The young woman's resolve crumbled weeks later when she was paired with Nina on an undertaking to recover a talisman sought by cultists. In a moment of heartache and weakness, she let her repressed fury spill out in a white-hot supernatural fire that consumed her friend on the spot.</p>\n<p>Although Helen blamed the murder on the cultists, the Protectors' first loss cast a heavy shadow on the remaining members. Meanwhile, guilt poisoned and ground down Helen such that outwardly she appeared distraught like her friends. Inside, her sanity slowly dissolved.</p>\n<h2>THE FINAL RITUAL</h2>\n<p>With the Convergence only a day away, supernatural chaos in Pinebox rose to a fever pitch. Fortunately, not all who felt the silent call were crazy or evil. Soldiers and scientists from nearby Base X and a secret troop of Texas Rangers called the Texas 13 set up a last line of defense at ground zero.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the Protectors tried one last gamble and captured a demon that had been terrorizing campus. Once imprisoned within their sanctuary, the private room where they conducted their more elaborate rituals, they bargained with the demon for the location of the Lantern of the Deep. Expecting trickery, the heroes left the demon entrapped while they raced to the talisman.</p>\n<p>The investigators found the lantern on Dale Island in Lake Greystone, cleared a space on the beach, and began the most dangerous ritual they had ever attempted. By merging and channeling the collective power of each investigator through the blue lens of the lantern, they pushed apart the warping ley lines.</p>\n<p>At the ritual's crescendo, the wild magic linked the friends together in heart, mind, and soul. In that moment, Helen's guilt and madness were finally laid bare for all. The ritual faltered, then failed. In the stunned silence that followed, Helen lashed out in shame and anger, killing her stupefied friends before they could recover. The last to die was her former lover, who had retreated to their boat with the talisman.</p>\n<p>Jack was a dozen yards from the island's shore when his former girlfriend's wrath caught up to him. In his final moments, Jack focused his will through the blue lens of the Lantern of the Deep and made himself a revenant&mdash;an undead guardian of the lantern immune to Helen's magic&mdash;and sank beneath the lake's surface.</p>\n<h2>THE BURN</h2>\n<p>Just as dawn began touching the treetops, exhausted, crying, and only partially aware of her surroundings, Helen pushed through the last thicket of heavy brush into ground zero of the Convergence. A zone of death lay hundreds of yards in front of her. Although no heat radiated from the ground, all plant and animal life appeared heavily charred.</p>\n<p>At the Convergence's epicenter on the crest of a small hill, Helen found the remains of a bitter battle between inhuman creatures and the Base X and Texas 13 allies. As with the plant life, nothing survived the wave of death that had washed outward from her spell.</p>\n<p>Although it appeared that the ritual had stopped the invasion, Helen prepared a scrying ritual to be certain. While she was casting, two survivors climbed the small hill and joined her. The pair from Base X, Thomas Brownell and Dr. Jenson, had been just beyond the edge of the wave of destruction. Wild magic unlocked psychic ability in one and genius in the other&hellip;in exchange for a lifetime of nightmares. When the ritual completed, the trio saw the ley lines had indeed been pushed apart, but not to their natural courses. The Protectors had only delayed the Convergence, not stopped it. Each traumatized in their own way by the previous night, the survivors vowed to stopsuch a catastrophe from happening again, at any cost.</p>\n<h2>THERE IS ANOTHER</h2>\n<p>Unknown to the trio, one other witness to the Battle of the Burn survived the night. While the struggle raged all around, the Texas 13's youngest member was struck in the back by a stray bullet. Nelson Baer lay bleeding and in agony when the wave of death silenced the battle. Hours later when he dragged himself to an abandoned Jeep, he vowed that he would change his name and start a new life. Although he left the Burn behind, he could never leave the guilt.</p>\n</div>\n</div>","_id":"FVySBcH8IfHPQ0gw"}

Even after Jenson's death, Sweet Heart continues funding research and development into all manner of ways to create the ultimate soldier. Some of these same methods have led to new treatments for degenerative diseases&mdash;medical patents that earn the company billions.</p>\n<p>Within the company, only a dozen \"inner circle\" members know about the Convergence and Sweet Heart's true mission. These trusted members are recruited for their extraordinary talent, such as being a master of the occult, a powerful psychic, or a biotech genius. Others&mdash;including corporate leadership&mdash;are only given enough information to perform their roles. Helen is satisfied calling the shots from the shadows, her puppeteer Talisman putting a swift end to dissent.</p>\n<p>Sweet Heart's vast operational budget easily allows the inner circle to buy the loyalty, or at least the silence, of anyone who stumbles upon secrets best left forgotten. When evidence of \"weird stuff\" reaches the Pinebox Police Department, Golan County Sheriff's Department, or even campus administration, there are those within who earn a tidy fortune by making it disappear. When in doubt about what Sweet Heart can or can't do, just remember: they have psychics, magic, and billions of dollars.</p>\n</section>\n<h3>SUPER HUMAN</h3>\n<p>With allies, if not a plan, Helen found a new cornerstone with which to rebuild her sanity. The trio determined that the Convergence would not form again for decades, giving them time to find a solution. Unlike her old friends, the new trinity vowed that morality was a luxury. What was the value of individual human life when all humanity could be extinguished in a supernatural apocalypse?</p>\n<p>Yet even freed from most moral constraints, time marched forward without bringing them any closer to a solution. After a decade of failure, the allies recruited others to their cause. While Helen focused on improving her ritual to reverse the Convergence, the others focused on building an army to fight what might come through. They called it their Super Human project, which became the genesis for a wave of valuable biotech patents under the guise of the Sweet Heart Foundation. Although only core, trusted members were revealed the full truth, the Foundation and its for-profit subsidiaries grew into a powerful, wealthy asset.</p>\n<h3>HELEN LACROIX</h3>\n<p>Of the original trinity, only Helen remains. An unintended consequence of slaughtering her friends during the unification ritual was the infusion of their magical abilities and life force. Although 60 years have passed, the sole remaining Protector is relatively untouched by age. Although she still directs her inner circle within Sweet Heart, she prefers to operate from the shadows and has changed her identity several times. Few living people know her past, and none know her secret shame.</p>\n<p>Today she calls herself Helen Lane and poses as a Cultural Studies professor at ETU, where she can monitor the Convergence and Sweet Heart. Although no less ruthless on matters of the Convergence, the years have mellowed the sorceress in other ways. She casually dates a colleague by the name of Dr. Glen Maclanahan, whom she also recruited into her inner circle due to his extensive knowledge of folklore and local legend.</p>\n<p>Although the Protectors' botched ritual bought the world a sixty-year reprieve, the ley lines are once again converging. This time, the epicenter is forming over the ETU campus rather than an isolated forest. Nexus points are themselves converging and merging, causing ever greater paranormal activity.</p>\n<p>While the Super Human project has made some recent successes pairing a genetically enhanced chupacabra with a psychic handler as a potential weapon against a demonic invasion, Helen's own long range plan is also nearing fruition. Using secret tunnels far beneath The Raven's Nest football stadium, she and her cabal of ritualists hope to release a burst of magic that will restore the ley lines to their natural paths. Yet the Convergence creeps ever closer and she still needs certain talismans and rare components to ensure success.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, the first cloned chupacabra creature is being tested and has been used on occasion to eliminate security leaks. In fact, brief sightings have already generated a campus urban legend of a spiny humanoid they call \"the Needler.\"</p>\n<p>Finally, the university prepares for the traditional orientation session for incoming Freshmen. Circumventing her more tepid Sweet Heart collaborators, \"Helen Lane\" sees an opportunity to head off the apocalypse even without the missing ritual components. All it needs is a mass sacrifice&hellip;</p>\n</div>\n</div>","_id":"MPxcdORVvNLsLJTd"}
